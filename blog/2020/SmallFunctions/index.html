          <main id="post">
            <p>
              In this post I’m going to go through some of the reasonings why
              small functions are usually better than large ones. Favouring
              “Small” is a reoccurring theme in software development. It is an
              axiom of problem solving that the way you solve large problems is
              to break them down into smaller ones. When it comes to creating
              user stories, the “S” in the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)"
                >INVEST</a
              >
              mnemonic stands for Small. It is the “micro” in micro-services.
              Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are not possible
              without keeping changes small. It is the 4th in the
              <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html"
                >four rules of simple design</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite being so prevalent, “Small” isn’t really a core principle
              of code quality. It is more a code smell, that indicates there may
              be a problem. By looking for cases of large functions, these often
              identify code that lacks symmetry, lacks expressiveness, has
              misleading comments, erodes trust, has too much coupling, lacks
              cohesion, or has too much duplication.
            </p>
            <p>Let’s jump into some code. First the small version:</p>
            <code>
              <pre>
  [Test]
  public void PersonSubscribesToNewspaper_AddsPersonToNewspaperSubscribers()
  {
    //Arrange
    var newspaper = CreateNewspaper();
    var reader = CreatePerson();
  
    //Act
    reader.Subscribe(newspaper);
  
    //Assert
    newspaper.Subscribers.ShouldContain(reader);
  }
</pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>Next the large version:</p>
            <code>
              <pre>
  [Test]
  public void PersonSubscribesToNewspaper_AddsPersonToNewspaperSubscribers()
  {
    //Arrange
    Newspaper newspaper;
    Person reader;
    using (var db = _unitOfWork.GetDatabaseMock())
    {
      newspaper = new Newspaper();
      newspaper.Id = Guid.NewGuid();
      newspaper.Name = "The Daily Chronicle";
      db.Newspapers.Add(newspaper);
  
      reader = new Person();
      reader.Id = Guid.NewGuid();
      reader.FirstName = "Alice";
      reader.LastName = "Smith";
      db.People.Add(reader);
  
      db.Save();
      db.Commit();
    }
  
    //Act
    reader.Subscribe(newspaper);
  
    //Assert
    newspaper.Subscribers.ShouldContain(reader);
  }
</pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              So you may guess that I’m going to take the position that the
              first, smaller method is better than the second. Here’s why:
            </p>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Symmetry</div>
              <p>
                When writing code there is always level of technical detail in
                that writing. Code can be written at a high level, for example
                “walk from point A to point B”. Or it can be written at a low
                level, “place left foot in front of right foot, lean forward
                until the body’s center of gravity is over the right foot, …”.
              </p>
              <p>
                The property of symmetry is that all the code in a function has
                the same level of technical detail (aka abstraction). The
                high-level functions read at a higher level of abstraction. Each
                time you step into a function you are stepping down a level of
                abstraction.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two reasons why symmetry is important, and ultimately
                makes the team more productive.
              </p>
              <div class="subsection-header">Multitasking</div>
              <p>
                Mixing up high level and low-level code forces the brain to work
                on two different wave lengths at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a writer, you want the reader to focus in on a single concept
                at a time. The reader can read it once, easily understand what
                the program is doing, commit it to memory, then move onto the
                next concept.
              </p>
              <p>
                Forcing the reader to switch between two levels of abstraction
                creates a context switch in the brain. The reader needs to jump
                between these levels. It is forcing the brain to multitask
                instead of focusing on a single task. When reading the large
                function, the reader will probably make this switch multiple
                times. The reader needs to sift through the low-level details
                and constantly recommit to memory their updated understanding of
                what the program is doing at a high level. The writer failed to
                provide a high-level map to the reader at the start, so the
                burden is on the reader to constantly redraw this map at each
                stage as their understanding of the code grows.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let me stop there and address some of the counterarguments. But
                “I’m great at multi-tasking”. No, you are not. Multitasking is a
                fallacy. You will be more productive and produce higher quality
                of work by single tasking. Go ahead and search for “Fallacy of
                Multitasking”. Here is
                <a
                  href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/31/the-fallacy-of-multitasking/#f0c7e4a6ba44"

                to get you started.
              </p>
              <p>
                “I’m clever enough to read the code, why aren’t you”? See my
                <a href="../../2015/Simply/Patterns/">previous post</a> on KISS
                and clever code.
              </p>
              <div class="subsection-header">Fewer Bugs</div>
              <p>
                The second (and most important) reason why symmetry is great is
                because…
              </p>
              <p class="lead px-5">
                Good symmetry in a code base leaves <u>nowhere</u> for bugs to
                hide.
              </p>
              <p>
                Doesn’t that sound great! It is true. Many times, working with
                my own code or in code reviews, I have found bugs simply
                refactoring the code to increase symmetry.
              </p>
              <p>
                By applying good symmetry, functions tend focus on a single
                thing. This allows functions to “do one thing and do it well”.
                It is hard to see the imperfections in the trees if you are
                focusing on the forest.
              </p>
              <p>
                And vice versa, sometimes while focusing on getting some
                technical minutiae correct, the writer can lose focus on getting
                the high-level details correct. It can be easy to focus too much
                on “building the thing right” instead of “building the right
                thing”. Separation makes sure that both of those concepts get
                the attention they deserve.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Expressiveness</div>
              <p>
                Let’s go back to the example code above. In the small function
                there are only 4 lines of code. The Arrange block has 2 lines of
                code. This code creates a Newspaper and it creates a Person.
              </p>
              <p>
                The details of how to create those objects is not important to
                what the writer is trying to convey. The method is an automated
                test method. Its purpose is to describe (or assert) the effect
                the production code (called from the Act block) should have.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Arrange block of the code is important. It sets the scene
                for the test method, much like a movie or book will set the
                scene before the action starts. Although this context is
                important, the author should not spend a great deal of time on
                this. Like all writing, this section should be succinct. It
                should only describe the context that is relevant to the action
                that is about to happen. The author should not describe every
                irrelevant blade of grass in the scene.
              </p>
              <p>
                There may be quite of a bit of work that needs to be done to
                create those two test objects. That is evident in the large
                version of the function. The test uses a database mock as a
                factory to create these objects. The Newspaper and the Person
                have some required fields, like Name and ID, that must be set,
                even though their values are not relevant to the high-level
                test. Those low-level details are not important to the
                high-level functionality of the test. Reading the small
                function, what we are testing is that a Newspaper should have
                access to the list of its subscribers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Expressing code in high level functions, is not that different
                than expressing code in high level languages. We code in
                languages like C# and Java instead of assembly for the same
                reasons we write high- and low-level functions in the same
                program. We favour high level languages because the better
                express what we are trying to do and make us more productive in
                the process.
              </p>
              <p>
                When writing low-level functions, there comes great
                responsibility. The one and only thing that the low-level
                function contributes to the code of the high-level function is
                the name of the low-level function.
              </p>
              <div class="subsection-header">Comments</div>
              <p>
                These function names are like comments that express what the
                code is doing. However, they are much better than comments.
                Comments tend to get stale. Often people will update the
                functionality of a piece of code with forgetting to update the
                comment. This is far less likely if function names are used to
                document the code. Favour creating a well named function over
                commenting a block of code.
              </p>
              <div class="subsection-header">Surprise and Trust</div>
              <p>
                It is critically important these functions are named well. When
                drilling down into lower level functions there should
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment"
                  >never be any surprises</a
                >. If you are accustomed to reading large functions changing to
                a paradigm of small functions can be jarring. Trust is earned.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the biggest complains about small functions is that the
                reader wants to get at those low-level details quickly, because
                that is what they are used to reading and it is familiar. IDEs
                have good tools for this, like in Visual Studio’s Go To
                Definition (F12), Navigate Back (Ctrl+-), and Peek Definition
                (Alt+F12). If the program is written well, drilling down into
                the low-level functions should not have any surprises. It should
                be boring, as boring as reading assembly code. When the reader
                drills down they should say to themselves, yes that is exactly
                what I expected that function to do. Eventually they will learn
                to trust the low-level functions and the desire to peek into
                them will ebb away. This will keep the code maintainer working
                at a higher level for longer periods. This makes them more
                productive, the same as high level programming languages are
                more productive than assembly.
              </p>
              <p>
                When people try to make the paradigm shift to smaller functions
                and there are a lot of surprises this can quickly derail the
                entire process. The surprises erode trust. There can be a quick
                reversal. “I told you small functions were a bad idea, let’s go
                back to large functions”. All the benefits I outline in this
                post are lost. Instead of reverting back to large functions,
                consider the root reasons why there is a lack of trust. How can
                that be improved?
              </p>
              <p>
                Often this just comes from finding a better name for the
                function, a name that better expresses what it does. This isn’t
                easy,
                <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html"
                  >naming is hard</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another possibility is the breakdown of functions isn’t quite
                right. There may be side effects in the functions that aren’t
                expressed. Yes, you can start by renaming the function so that
                the side effect isn’t surprising (e.g.
                DoWorkAndDoSideEffect();). However, often this leads down a path
                of teasing apart side effects from core functionality, which
                leads to a much better software design.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe there are parallels between a team of coders that
                learn to trust each other’s small functions, and an organization
                where all colleagues can delegate work to each other, trust it
                is completed properly, without a need to micro-manage each

                When separating out code, this must be done intelligently. Small
                functions don’t yield better code just because they are small.
                Programs with smaller functions, when separated properly, do
                have a better design.
              </p>
              <p>
                First an example. Let’s say you have a gasoline powered car. You
                want to redesign it so that the car is less dependent on the
                gasoline.
              </p>
              <p>
                One way to redesign the car it to attach a trailer to the car
                then move the gas tank from under the car to the trailer.
                Finally run a hose from the gas tank in the trailer to the
                engine in the front of the car.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this design you haven’t made the car any less depend on the
                gasoline. Yes, the car weighs less with the gas tank removed (it
                is smaller), but it is not better designed. All that has been
                done is made it more likely to explode.
              </p>
              <p>
                To truly make the car less dependent on the gasoline, the car
                must be designed so that the engine that still depends on the
                gasoline is also easily separated from the car. The gasoline
                tank and the gasoline engine are, and always will be, tightly
                coupled. The car shouldn’t be orchestrating how to get gasoline
                from the tank to the engine. The car should just be asking an
                engine for power and let the engine worry about were it gets
                that power from. If the car doesn’t like how the engine produces
                its power the car can replace it with another engine.

              <p>
                A great advantage of separating high- and low-level functions is
                that the high-level functions get to delegate to the low-levels
                to do some work. The high levels don’t care how that work is
                done.
              </p>
              <p>
                The high-level functions should truly be delegating, not
                orchestrating or micromanaging. The high-level function doesn’t
                tell the low levels to put one foot in front of the other in a
                walking motion, the high level delegates the responsibility of
                moving from point A to point B.
              </p>
              <p>
                When this is done properly, the separation of concerns should be
                truly separate. That will yield a highly decoupled design.
                Because the high levels don’t know or care how the low levels
                get their work done, the low levels are free to change their
                implementation or technology stack when they want.

              <p>
                As you are separating, pay close attention to the parameters
                that need to be passed around between the functions. Separating
                out a 100-line function into two isn’t actually the proper thing
                to do if you have to pass 50 parameters between them.
              </p>
              <p>
                A simple way to pass fewer parameters is to use class level
                fields or properties. As you do this, you will probably notice
                that the low-level functions all tend to use the same fields.
                Move the fields vertically closer to the functions that use
                them. What often happens is the high-level functions and their
                fields are at the top of the file and the low-level fields and
                functions are at the bottom. Once the code is grouped like this
                it may be possible to move the low-level functions into a
                separate class.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you maximize cohesion you are identifying and separating out
                bits of code that are tightly coupled. Increasing cohesion,
                reduces coupling.

              <div class="section-header">Remove Duplication</div>
              <p>
                Breaking large functions into smaller ones is a great way to
                identify and eliminate duplication. A lot of developers don’t
                even realize how much duplication there is in their code until
                they start trying to tease it apart. Just like how small
                functions doesn’t leave any place for bugs to hide, there is no
                place for duplication to hide either.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m not going to go into an exhaustive analysis on how small
                functions remove duplication. When you remove duplication, the
                code becomes more expressive as a side effect; when you make the
                code more expressive, duplication will be removed as a side
                effect. One leads to another in a tight feedback loop. J.B.
                Rainsberger explains this very well
                <a
                  href="https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/putting-an-age-old-battle-to-rest"
                  >here</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                While moving duplicate code into functions, the code becomes
                reusable and this lowers the maintenance costs of the code base.
                However, I do want to point out is that code reuse is not the
                only reason to create small functions. Some will argue that if a
                function is only called once that there is no point is
                separating it and should be in-lined. In-lining these functions
                avoids unnecessary jumping around when trying to read the code.
              </p>
              <p>
                I respectfully disagree with this. Single-use functions are
                extremely useful in a code base. The function name adds to the
                expressiveness and symmetry of the code base and eliminates the
                need for comments. It adds structure to the program, which leads
                to a better design. These considerations also lead to a lower
                maintenance cost on a code base, even if there is no code reuse.

                In conclusion, large functions are a code smell that if fixed
                nudges the code a better design. Small functions enhance the
                symmetry, expressiveness, cohesion, and reuse of a code base.
                All of this results in a lower maintenance cost.
