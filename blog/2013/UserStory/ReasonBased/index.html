          <main id="post">
            <p>
              In my
              <a href="../IsTheThing/">previous post</a>
              I described my feeling on why it is so critically important to
              develop a good user story.&nbsp; However I didn’t go into much
              detail on how that is done.&nbsp; I’m going to cover that in this
              post.&nbsp; I’ll start by looking at the classic “goal/desire”
              based user story formats, followed by my own reason based format,
              then an example.
            </p>

            <section>
              
                <div class="section-header">
                  Classic “Goal/Desire” Based User Story Formats
                </div>
              
  
              <p>
                The traditional format of a user story is “As a &lt;role&gt;, I
                want &lt;goal/desire&gt; [so that &lt;benefit&gt;]”.&nbsp; For
                example, “As a billing officer, I want to search for unbilled
                completed orders so that I can bill the customer”.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Now there is some debate as to how important the &lt;benefit&gt;
                clause is in the user story.&nbsp; In the above example it seems
                kind of obvious that the benefit is the ability to bill customers,
                and that is a good thing.&nbsp; Some stay that it is so obvious
                that it can just be omitted.&nbsp; Others argue that the
                &lt;benefit&gt; clause is the most important part of the user
                story and it should be stated first.&nbsp; That format is “In
                order to &lt;receive benefit&gt; as a &lt;role&gt;, I want
                &lt;goal/desire&gt;”.&nbsp; In this example it would read “In
                order to bill customers as a billing officer, I want to search for
                unbilled completed orders”.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The &lt;goal/desire&gt; clause of the user story is the really
                difficult part to get right.&nbsp; There is a real art to
                this.&nbsp; You are describing a desired solution (i.e. a
                requirement), but it must be stated in a way that allows for
                flexibility and out-of-the-box thinking.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For example let’s examine if the user story was restated “As a
                billing officer, I want unbilled completed orders to be
                highlighted in red”.&nbsp; This is much more restrictive than the
                first statement.&nbsp; This really binds the hands of the
                developer, product manager, or UX designer.&nbsp; Before anyone
                can suggest alternatives, they have to convince the person
                submitting the user story to throw out they story in its current
                form, go back to the drawing board, and restate their requirement
                in a wording that is more flexible.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Even my original example can be too restrictive.&nbsp; Is manually
                searching for unbilled completed orders the best solution?&nbsp;
                How about emailing a these orders directly to the billing
                officer?&nbsp; How about automating the billing process so that
                there is no need to search for unbilled completed orders?<o:p
                ></o:p>
              </p>
  
              <p>
                I believe it is nearly impossible to get the goal/desire clause of
                the user story to be flexible enough to allow for a truly open
                discussion. &nbsp;Therefore, I advise against trying to use this
                format as a starting point.&nbsp; My preferred process for
                developing a user story is as follows.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">
                Reason Based User Story
              </div>
  
              <p>
                I find when creating a user story, or any activity, the best place
                to start with the reason.&nbsp; It is critical that everyone knows
                why something is worth doing before doing it.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The reason should be broken into two parts: the problem and the
                impact to the business.&nbsp;
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The problem statement is usually fairly easy to collect.&nbsp;
                This can be done listening to the user’s gripes as they are doing
                their job or “at the water cooler”.&nbsp; The problem statement
                that is written in the user story can usually be done verbatim
                from the end-user.&nbsp;
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The next step is for a business analyst to assess the impact of
                that problem on the business.&nbsp; The business analyst’s work
                results on assigning a value or benefit to the issue.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                After the business analyst drafts the impact statement, it is
                important that this is reviewed (i.e. tested).&nbsp; The end-user
                and their managers submitting the problem statement should review
                the analyst’s impact assessment to ensure there are no
                communication errors.&nbsp; The problem and impact statement are
                the first milestone in creating a user story.&nbsp; With this work
                done it can be entered onto the backlog.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                So the impact statement serves the same purpose as the benefit
                clause from the traditional user story format.&nbsp; However the
                formats are very different. &nbsp;The reason format attaches a
                real end-user’s problem to the benefit clause, whereas the
                traditional user story format attaches the benefit to a goal or
                solution. &nbsp;The reason needs to be able to stand on its own,
                independent of solution.&nbsp; This allows the end users and
                business analysts to discuss the value of the problem without the
                potential solutions biasing that discussion.&nbsp; It also gives
                the business a firm footing to start on before evaluating
                potential solutions.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                With the problem well defined, the next step is for the business
                to seek multiple solutions.&nbsp; These solutions should be sought
                from both internal employees and external vendors.&nbsp; Both high
                and low tech solutions should be welcome.&nbsp; The business can
                then evaluate each solution for how well it will solve the
                problem.&nbsp; Estimates can be gathered for the most promising
                solutions.&nbsp; Often multiple solutions will be chosen to be
                implemented to cover any gaps or to provide redundancy in the
                system.

              <p>So let’s apply this methodology to an example problem.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="ml-5">
                <b>Problem:</b> Some customers are not being billed for their
                completed orders.

              <p>Next we attach an impact statement to the problem.</p>
  
              <p class="ml-5">
                <b>Impact:</b> Missing billing opportunities have been estimated
                at $50K per month of missing revenue.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Then we can start collecting solutions from a variety of people.

                With the suggestions collected the business people can analyze how
                effective each suggestion would be at solving the problem.&nbsp;
                Sometimes seeing all the various solutions can lead people to more
                solutions.&nbsp; For example, “As a Developer, I could change the
