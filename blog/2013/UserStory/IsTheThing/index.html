              I’m a big fan of the
              <a href="http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html"
                >Evil Overload List</a
              >. It is a list of handy suggestions of things not to do for
              anyone that wants to take over the world, such as “don’t
              monologue”. Many of tips aren’t just for evil overlords, but also
              are very applicable to software development. I believe the most
              important lesson from this list for anyone in software development
              is: If my advisors ask "Why are you risking everything on such a
              mad scheme?”, I will not proceed until I have a response that
              satisfies them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I consider having a good
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">user story</a>
              to be the most import part of the development process. When
              requirements are handed to developers they must understand the
              value that will give the end users. They need to understand not
              only the solution that they are being asked to implement, but the
              problem end users are having and how that problem impacts their
              business. Digging into the reason behind each software change
              allows developers to better understand the job the end users are
              trying to accomplish, increases the developer’s domain knowledge,
              and allows them to become active participants in recommending
              alternate solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I simply will not put up with bad user stories. I have to
              understand value behind any feature I’m asked to implement before
              I will attempt to code it. Some developers don’t do this, and
              frankly that scares me. Without a good user story there is a high
              potential for introducing inconsistencies into the system and
              bloat the code to the point that nobody understands how or why it
              works the way it does. This must be avoided for the health of the
              product.
            </p>
            <div class="container mb-3">
              <div class="row">

                        If any developer feels the need to improve the user
                        story, solution, or requirement they are presented with
                        that developer needs to be empowered, nay encouraged, to
                        ask whatever questions are necessary to improve that
                        user story.

            <p>
              If there is a bad user story I will investigate further until I am
              satisfied that I know why we are doing what we are doing. Some
              people might get annoyed (or even offended) by me investigating
              (second-guessing) their solutions/requirements. They may think
              that I am just wasting time. They may try to squash the
              conversation, bypass the explanation phase, and try to get me to
              jump to the coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a few ways they try to get me coding. The most common is
              to ask if “can” implement their solution. They present it as a
              challenge and are looking for a simple yes or no answer. It’s a
              loaded question because they know their solution is possible to
              implement. My response is, “I can make a computer do anything I
              want it to. The real question is, should I?” This “can you”
              question sometimes comes in the form of asking the developer for
              an estimate of a predetermined solution instead of asking them if
              they think it is a good idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another common way people try to bypass the user story is to quote
              the “customer (or boss) is always right” rule. Having a stance
              that the customer/boss is enlightened and it is somehow acceptable
              to keep developers in the dark is the very definition of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom_management"
                >mushroom management</a
              >. Asking questions doesn’t imply that their requested solution is
              wrong; I’m just asking them to share their enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>
              I do understand the appeal of jumping to the solution. We praise
              the problem solver. They are treated as more virtuous that those
              that simply gripe about problems and offer no constructive
              solutions for them. Although being a problem solver will likely
              result in individual praise, there is no I in team. To build a
              good team and to be a good teacher you need to ask good questions.
              You need to let the team members at least have a chance to answer
              those questions before doing all the thinking for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              OK, enough rant. So how can do you actual write a good user story?
              I cover that in my next post,
