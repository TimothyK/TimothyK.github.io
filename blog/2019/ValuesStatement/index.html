            <p>
              A few months ago, the company I work for redid their corporate
              vision/mission statement. It was a very positive process. It holds
              people accountable and makes sure that everyone behaves in a way
              that supports those values.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thought it would be a good idea to write down some of my own,
              personal values I hold as a software professional. I, Timothy
              Klenke, will not act against these values. I would consider it
              unethical to act against these stated values. I hold myself to be
              accountable to them, and others may hold me to this as well.
            </p>

              <li><b>I will provide value to my customers and employer.</b></li>
              <li><b>I will deliver software with the utmost quality.</b></li>
              <li><b>I will continue to improve and learn.</b></li>
              <li><b>I will do all of the above in a sustainable way.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Last month I did a full blog
              <a href="../Empowerment/">post on empowerment, so see that</a>
              for more details. The short version is that given the same access
              to information I should be able to make the same decisions as my
              co-workers and bosses, and vice versa. If we are making different
              decisions then there is likely an information gap, i.e. a learning
              opportunity. Depending on others to make similar decisions to what
              I would do is the essence of trust. When there are differences in
              opinion, the built up trust constrains differences to within a
              shared set of values. The shared set of values fosters mutual
              respect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Providing value to customers is the only reason to write software
              professionally. The software improves the quality of life of the
              end users by making their lives easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a logical “AND” in that statement to provide value to
              customers AND employer; it is not one or the other. I will not
              screw over the customer for the benefit of my employer or vice
              versa.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have purposely included a statement about providing value to my
              employer so remind myself of my commitment to do all those
              business type chores (e.g. doing time sheets, etc.) even when I
              would rather be coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quality of the software I write is paramount. It does not matter
              how technical or lay you are within the software profession, it is
              easy to universally agree that software should work. This is
              <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html"
                >Beck’s first and highest priority rule</a
              >
              for simple design and if unsatisfied all other discussions are
              moot. You cannot deliver value to your customers or work in a
              sustainable way if the software you are working on is routinely
              breaking because of poor quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no such thing as perfect software or a perfect person.
              However, there does exist the concept of continuous improvement. I
              will improve those ever-so-hard “soft-skills” to work better with
              my colleagues to learn from each other (i.e. empower). I will
              improve my software quality. I will learn new technologies and
              skills to improve my productivity. I will improve both in breadth
              and depth; I will not only get better with the tools I already am
              familiar with, but also reach out to learn new skills that am not
              yet aware of.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is critical I do all of these tasks in a sustainable manner. If
              I cannot deliver the same quality and value at the same level from
              project to project then this will erode trust. I will not take
              short cuts, like skipping code reviews or testing, which may
              affect quality. I will keep my code clean and avoid technical
              debt. I will avoid an overtime death-march to deliver software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, I, Timothy Klenke, will not act against these values. I
              would consider it unethical to act against these stated values. I
              hold myself to be accountable to them, and others may hold me to
              this as well.
