              How much overtime are you willing to work? How much compensation
              should there be? Does this depend on the type of work? These are
              all good questions. Before doing a
              <a href="../../2018/CodeReview/HowTo/">code review</a>
              it is a good idea to have a set of agreed on coding standards.
              Similarly, it is important to think about the answers to these
              questions ahead of time, before you are pressured (either by
              yourself or externally) to work overtime. Make sure you have an
              established set of values so that you can confidently make future
              decisions that are consistent with your goals and limits.

              <div class="section-header">The Pros</div>
              <p>
                Before getting to the various situations regarding my personal
                overtime policy, I will state just some of the pros and cons of
                working overtime.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some definite pros to working overtime. A hard day’s
                work builds a sense of accomplishment. If after an 8-hour day of
                nothing but meetings, phone calls, and other interruptions you
                fell as if you got nothing accomplished, a couple hours of
                uninterrupted coding after everyone has gone home can make it
                feel like you salvaged your day. If you had a productive day and
                were “in the zone”, you may want to ride that wave a little
                longer. That sense of accomplishment can give you a boost of
                energy, like how joggers claim to feel invigorated from jogging.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is just some of the pros from working overtime for
                yourself. There is a good chance that others will notice your
                hard work too. It can be a definite ego boost to have others
                appreciate you for your hard work. This can lead to salary jumps
                as well. It is true that the harder you work at your career the
                more benefits you will probably get from it.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">The Cons</div>
              <p>
                There are some definite cons to working overtime. For starters,
                it leads to exhaustion and fatigue. There is a maximum number of
                hours that can be worked by a software developer and maintain a
                high level of focus. An 80-hour workweek will not yield double
                the productivity as a 40-hour workweek. The fatigue will result
                in distractions, which drop productivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working overtime is done because you are putting pressure on
                yourself to get something done. That pressure causes stress. A
                little bit of stress can be a good thing, like a little
                adrenaline boost. Too much stress is a bad thing. It can lead to
                stress eating, increased alcohol consumption, and larger mental
                health issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Increasing overtime affects family life, aka “work/life
                balance”. The more time working the less time there is for the
                spouse, children, and friends. When I am working a lot of
                overtime there is certainly less time sitting around the table
                eating a home cooked meal and more fast food so that I can
                quickly get back to work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the work I do out of office is keeping up to date on the
                latest technologies. That is an important job of any software
                professional. If I am working a lot of overtime just to get
                customer projects done, then there is less available time for me
                to stay current.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is potential when working a lot of overtime to create
                developer silos. A developer can work for months on a project
                outside normal work hours without interaction with the rest of
                the team. Is there the normal guidance from a design committee,
                are there code reviews, and are system integration and customer
                acceptance tests being included? If I am working a lot of
                overtime on a customer project that is required to meet the same
                “definition of done” as all my other projects then this will
                create pressure on other teammates to work extra overtime as
                well in order to support me.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Corporate Policy</div>
              <p>
                It should be the policy of any sustainable company that working
                overtime should not be plan “A”. There are some exceptions for
                seasonal companies. For example, game developers often have an
                annual deadline to release for Christmas/Black Friday sales,
                accountants work long hours during tax season, and farmers work
                hard during harvest. Owners can communicate that they will not
                approve vacations and overtime is not optional during that busy
                month. After that month of overtime surge there will be a
                recovery break. Overtime is not being required every single
                month of the year.
              </p>
              <p>
                In sustainable companies, there should not be a plan to demand
                overtime at the start of a project or sprint. If you get 75%
                through a sprint or project it and realize that the team will
                not meet the deadline then it is decision time. Either the
                project manager will extend the deadline or work items be
                deferred to the next sprint, or overtime will be approved to get
                the project or sprint done on time. However, that is a red flag
                that the team is not good at estimating, project planning, or
                some other shortcoming. The team must work to fix whatever the
                shortcomings are. If not addressed, the likely outcome is that
                all projects or sprints will demand overtime.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a company has difficultly in getting out of the habit of
                demanding employees routinely work overtime then a policy of
                paying time-and-a-half can give the company the nudge it needs
                to break this habit.
              </p>
              <p>
                There must be an allowance to expect the unexpected. Getting 75%
                through a project and realizing that there is more work than
                expected is common. Because plan “A” did not include overtime,
                adding overtime is still an open option. If plan “A” was to work
                overtime then when unexpected things happen the only recourse is
                to add even more overtime or let the deadline lapse. Good
                planning is to leave as many options open as possible. To have
                plan “A” being to work overtime reduces the number of options
                available in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Employees should always have the option to refuse overtime.
                Companies are not always (nor should be) privy to personal
                details of employee’s lives that may restrict their ability to
                work overtime. Refusal must be a real option. An employer may
                ask employees to work overtime, but employees need a safe place
                to refuse. An employer cannot claim that they give the option to
                refuse overtime, but if any employee does refuse overtime then
                there will be consequences. For refusing overtime, employers
                should not blacklist employees as “not a team player” which will
                influence bonuses or salary.

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Personal Overtime Policy</div>
              <p>
                So with the preamble out of the way, let me finally get to my
                person overtime policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are my own personal values guiding my own overtime policy.
                I think it is important that I write them down so that I can
                refer to them later. These policies apply only to me. I
                recognize that every software professional will have his or her
                own policies. I will respect everyone’s opinion and will not
                demand others work more or less that me, even if they choose to
                work no overtime at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are numerous situations that I will work overtime free. I
                consider this part of my salary and just coming with the
                territory of being a professional software developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whatever overtime I choose to work, I will ensure that I am
                <span class="skim-focus">well rested</span>. I try not to work so much overtime on
                personal projects that it interferes with the productivity in my
                day job. I will cycle on the amount of overtime I work. I may
                work a month where I put in a lot of overtime, but them I follow
                that where I try to limit myself to just 9 to 5.
              </p>
              <p>
                I do spend an enormous amount of “<span class="skim-focus">think time</span>”. I
                brainstorm ideas. I think up different ways to approach coding
                problems or present arguments to other people. I have no idea
                how much time I spend on this (which is why I could not charge
                for this even if I wanted to), but it is a lot.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes I will work overtime just for my own
                <span class="skim-focus">personal integrity</span> of hitting a deadline that I have
                committed to. For example, someone asking me a brief question
                about his or her project can distract me. After they leave, my
                mind may still be racing with the details of their project. It
                is my fault alone that I cannot focus on my assigned task. I may
                end up working extra overtime to make sure I complete my task on
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I do think that all professional software developers do need to
                some of their own time to <span class="skim-focus"></span>learn new technologies</span>. It can
                be a full time job just staying current. I am not expecting to
                be an expert on every latest trend. However, I do expect all
                developers to read up on new technologies and go through a few
                throwaway example programs. I would not expect a company to
                cover 100% of the cost of training its employees on new
                technology; it is just easier to hire new college kids that
                already have this training.
              </p>
              <p>
                Learning new technologies is the only point where I do expect
                that all developers will spend at least some time on their own.
                I think it fair to companies to expect this as well. However,
                this does not have to be a daily demand. It is fine to take a
                few months off (or more) in order to maintain a good work/life
                balance and pick this up at a time when it is more appropriate.
                If companies do demand this then they cannot be assigning too
                much other (e.g. customer project) overtime work. Companies must
                give employees enough free time to meet their learning
                obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Learning technologies is one thing, but the eventual goal of
                that is to <span class="skim-focus">on-ramp that new technology</span> into your
                day-to-day work. I know that new technology will make me more
                productive. However, the switchover time and training of my
                colleagues can make the new tech seem somewhat dubious. If I can
                work a little extra to get documentation done or create little
                helper functions or snippets to make the on ramping seamless, I
                think this is time well spent. I find it hard to ask my company
                to invest in this time on unproven technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the same vein, “talk is cheap, show me the code”. Sometimes I
                have difficulty getting people to believe in a new technology or
                strategy. A good way to counter this is write a quick, throwaway
                proof-of-concept application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those are some of the conditions that I am willing to work free
                overtime. Of course, I am not above taking money for that. If
                someone wants to pay me to go to conference to learn new
                technologies or split the costs of on ramping, then I am cool
                with that. Offering a small bonus to learn new skills is
                welcome, even if that bonus works out to well below the legal
                minimum hourly wage.
              </p>
              <p>
                I do not think it is fair to work on customer projects at
                reduced pay. Learning new technologies benefits my employer and
                me, whereas meeting a customer’s project deadline mostly only
                helps my employer.
