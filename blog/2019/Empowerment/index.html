          <main id="post">
            <p>
              The objective of empowerment is to enable someone (or everyone) on
              a team to be able to make the same decisions that the team leader
              (or CEO) would make.
            </p>
            <p>
              Empowerment is difficult to implement. It is not as easy as the
              leader saying, “OK, everyone’s empowered. Do whatever you want.
              I’m taking a nap.” This would result in anarchy. Each person would
              be off in their own silo, potentially pulling the company in
              different directions.
            </p>
            <p>
              True empowerment starts with the leader ensuring that everyone
              understands
              <span class="skim-focus">the corporate values and vision</span>.
              Employees also need to know what processes are already in place.
              Ensuring work is consistent with the corporate values and vision
              is the reason why processes exist. An empowered employee needs to
              know how each process supports that corporate vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              The leader must also provide direction on
              <span class="skim-focus">priorities</span> of the company. It is
              easy to say in a mission statement that, “we will be awesome at
              everything, all the time”. In the real world, people are going to
              have to make compromises. The leader and empowered employees need
              to know what the priorities of the company are under various
              contexts. The true test of the
              <span class="skim-focus">integrity</span> of a company is will all
              empowered employee come to approximately the same decision with
              the same information.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible to <span class="skim-focus">test</span> the level
              of empowerment in a team. You can quiz team members and leaders by
              giving them the same information and ask them to make a decision.
              Ask them to make a decision not based on their own person opinions
              and values, but instead make the decision based on the known
              values of the corporation (more on this later). If the information
              is equal, everyone should come to the same decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              When there are disagreements, these are the most interesting times
              for the company and employees.
              <span class="skim-focus">Exploring</span> the reasons for the
              differences is critical. It does nothing for the integrity of the
              company if people just “agree to disagree” or storm off. Empowered
              employees should be able to have a rational discussion on why they
              feel their decision best supports the values of the company.
              Discussing these differences thoroughly refines and
              <span class="skim-focus">matures</span> the company vision and
              serves to remove ambiguity in priorities. Successful empowerment
              of employees leads to less conflict between employees, not more.
            </p>
            <p>
              The values of the <span class="skim-focus">individuals</span> that
              make up the company should align with the values of the company
              itself. Like differences between team members, addressing
              differences between employees and company is critical. Companies
              are usually open to adjustments to values and processes over time.
              Hiring of disruptive people
              <span class="skim-focus">challenges</span> the status quo, and
              that can be a good thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, note that allowing employees to
              <span class="skim-focus">vote</span> on an issue is not
              empowerment. All that a vote does is allow personal opinions to
              replace corporate values. A team should be able to discuss a
              decision at hand within the context of corporate values and come
              to a virtually unanimous decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Implementing a “<span class="skim-focus">chain of command</span>”
              is the antithesis of empowerment. Consulting an organizational
              chart to answer whom should make a decision is a red flag that
              employees are not empowered. Empowered employees, regardless of
              where they fall on an organization chart, should be making the
              same decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disagreements on priorities will occur between all team members
              from time to time and at all levels. Exploring these differences
              is critical even if the difference is between the CEO and lowest
              level of empowered employee. It is easy to jump to the conclusion
              that the CEO is always right, but there are many reasons why this
              may not be the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              The usual reason why two empowered employees disagree is they are
              working with different information. Employees generally have more
              information relevant to the task at hand than the CEO. CEOs
              usually want to empower their employees because they acknowledge
              that they cannot know everything that all their employees combined
              know. It is impossible to grow a company if the CEO is required to
              know everything all their employees know and make all decisions.
              CEOs are human beings and have limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is the <span class="skim-focus">duty</span> of an empowered
              employee to test their assumptions on current priorities and
              corporate values against other empowered employees, especially
              their leaders. Leaders can make decisions that go against the
              corporate values all the time, usually due to missing information
              that only the employees know. It is the duty of the employee to
              correct this so that suboptimal decisions do not
              <span class="skim-focus">propagate</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another reason why it is the duty of employees to understand and
              reconcile why their decisions are different from their leaders is
              to build <span class="skim-focus">trust</span>. It is easy to
              follow the leader’s orders when they are standing over your
              shoulder. However, if the leader leaves the room or goes on
              vacation, they are expecting that their empowered employees will
              make the same decisions they would in their absence.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-5">
              On a personal note, empowerment is the most important value I hold
              professionally. Not just that I am empowered, but also that
              everyone I work with is empowered. This goes back to
              <a href="../../2013/UserStory/IsTheThing/"
                >my very first blog post</a
              >
              from 5 years ago. That post discussed/ranted on the importance to
              know the reason “why” before implementing any customer enhancement
              request. Just because the customer orders this, is not enough.
              This post is similar in that the importance of knowing “why” for
              all work assignments. Just because the leader orders this, is not
              enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although having empowered employees is very beneficial for the
              internal corporate culture, it has other benefits as well.
              Empowerment builds the
              <span class="skim-focus">integrity</span> of a company. It ensures
              that everyone in a company hold the same values and ethics. It
              tests that regardless of which employee is assigned, the results
              will be consistent and to the agreed upon standards. This
              integrity will be visible to the company’s customers.
            </p>

              In addition, here is a great talk on empowerment:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivwKQqf4ixA">[link]</a>.
              It is by David Marquet discussing empowerment on nuclear submarine
              in the US Navy. It is from 2016. It is a newer version of a TED
              talk from 2012. Please watch the newer video; I think it is
              better. However, do look at the
              <a href="https://youtu.be/DLRH5J_93LQ?t=887"
                >tail end of the 2012 TED talk</a
              >
              for great example of a great result from empowerment.
