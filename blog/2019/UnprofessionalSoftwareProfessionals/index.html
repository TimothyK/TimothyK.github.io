          <main id="post">
            <p>
              Before I talk about the software professionals, let me first say a
              little something about American politics. Boy, this blog post has
              gone off the rails quickly. Don’t worry; I won’t talk about Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is one of the best and most well known quotes of all time
              from any American president:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="px-5">
              <p class="lead mb-0">
                <i
                  >“Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can
                  do for your country,”</i
                >
              </p>
              <div class="blockquote-footer text-right">John F. Kennedy</div>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This quote speaks to and appeals to people’s sense of patriotism.
              It inspires action, incremental improvement, and inclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast, here is another often-used phrase in American
              political “debate” that also speaks to patriotism:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="px-5">
              <p><i>[You are] un-American.</i></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              It is easy to hear this phrase daily in American politics.
              Sometimes it is used to directly describe a person or just their
              ideas (but that has the same effect). It meant to appeal to
              people’s sense of patriotism; however, it does a much poorer job
              than JFK’s words.
            </p>
            <p>
              This “un-American” statement is usually used in a highly illogical
              manner. It is used to describe people that have American birth
              certificates and passports; i.e. Americans. It is very easy to
              prove they are American, but they are described as un-American.
              This phrase marginalizes people. If they clearly are American and
              not an American at the same time, then this contradiction means
              they cannot exist and are nothing. In most contexts, it
              immediately puts a person on the defensive. It causes division
              between those that are and are not American; even between people
              that are suppose to be on the same team.
            </p>
            <p>
              This phrase prevents action because it changes the context of the
              conversation from some actionable item that is currently under
              debate to a philosophical discussion on what it means to be
              American (with no action items). It does not speak to what should
              be done, but instead focuses on what should be believed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason to use this phrase is usually to attempt to shut down a
              debate. It does not encourage further action or debate. If debate
              does continue after this statement is usually turns more vicious.
              If the conversion stops after this statement it is not because the
              argument has been won, it is because people do not wish to turn
              the conversation in this vicious direction.
            </p>

              <b><u>Back to the Software Profession</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason why I am writing this blog post is to advise software
              professionals avoid calling their colleagues “unprofessional”. I
              have heard this phrase used on Twitter and at conferences and in
              those contexts my reaction was “Hell, yeah!” However, many years
              ago I have used this statement in my workplace and heard others
              use this and it never ends well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Never call someone that is paid to deliver software as
              unprofessional. By definition, if they receive a paycheck, they
              are a professional. This is completely illogical and easily
              disproven to say otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know that my definition for a “software professional” (i.e.
              anyone that is paid) is a somewhat over-simplistic and
              controversial statement. Our industry does have a bit of problem
              that there is not a clear, universally accepted definition of what
              it means to be a software professional. It is a common theme of
              Uncle Bob (<a href="https://youtu.be/p0O1VVqRSK0?t=385"
                >see here</a
              >
              and <a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1094">here</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              However, despite the lack of an organization accrediting who is a
              software professional and who is not, some common values tend to
              come up repeatedly when we speak about software professionalism.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                We should provide value to our customers. (hard to get paid if
                you are not doing this one)
              </li>
              <li>
                Quality of software should be paramount. (hard to get paid for
                something that doesn’t work)
              </li>
              <li>There must be continuing learning and improvement.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              If you are doing these things then it should be easy to be paid
              and be able to call yourself a software professional. If you are
              not doing these things then it will be harder to stay employed.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are days when I’m at a meeting at work in some heated
              discussion and I think to myself that I am the only one in the
              room that cares about our customers, or quality, or progressing to
              a new technology. In addition, I am sure that every one of my
              colleagues have felt the same, perhaps even in the same meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
              At a political rally, you might be able to get away with calling
              people un-American. When you are in church, there are things that
              can be said when preaching to the choir that are inspiring, but
              when taken outside the church sound “preachy” and condescending.
              On Twitter and at software conferences it might be safe to accuse
              those that do not put quality above all else as unprofessional,
              but it is usually unwelcome, untrue, and unhelpful in most other
              situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b><u>Ways forward</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are tempted to call your colleagues “unprofessional”,
              take a deep breath, count to 10, and try to remember JFK’s words.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason you are tempted to call someone unprofessional is
              usually frustration that “the country is not doing enough for
              you”. You have some expectations on what your company and its
              employees (i.e. your country) should be doing for you and you are
              disappointed. Calling them unprofessional is another way of
              stating that they are not doing enough for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are a few statements that you might be familiar with that
              reflect disappointment and division with others:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Customers or business analysts didn’t do a good enough job
                specifying requirements
              </li>
              <li>
                Developers put too many bugs in the software and/or aren’t
                following best practices
              </li>
              <li>Testers didn’t do a good enough job doing testing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These statements all blame others for essentially being
              unprofessional. Instead of making statements like these, think of
              JFK and ask what you can do. What are you doing to improve
              customer value, quality, and knowledge by yourself and of your
              teammates?
            </p>
            <p>
              Sit down and make a list of all the things you are doing to
              improve customer value, quality, and learning. List the things you
              are doing personally, not want you wish others were doing. It is
              hypocritical to demand things from your colleagues if you cannot
              come up with a list of the things you are doing yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then come up with a list of things you are doing or could be doing
              to help your colleagues do their job. Do not list of the things
              you wish you colleagues were doing on their own; list only the
              things that you can provide assistance. Ask what you can do for
              them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure that this is productive. Do not simply do their job for
              them (that old “<a
                href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give_a_man_a_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_day;_teach_a_man_to_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_lifetime"
                >give a man a fish</a
              >” saying). If your plan is to teach them something, be sure they
              want to learn and you are not doing this in a condescending way.
              Many hands may light work; if you can get a team to collectively
              progress towards a goal this may be more effective that picking on
              one person to do the work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Asking JFK’s question of “what you can do” should be part of every
              retrospective. Have a list of things to do in the next sprint, and
              a backlog of things you want to do over the next few months.
