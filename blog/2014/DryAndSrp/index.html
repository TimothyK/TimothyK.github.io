              Kent Beck’s
              <a href="http://xp.c2.com/XpSimplicityRules.html"

              >
              (aka Four Rules of Simple Design) are a prioritized list of rules
              that when applied to your code generally yield a great design. As
              you’ll see from the above link the list has slightly evolved over
              time. I find today they are usually listed as:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>All Tests Pass</li>
              <li>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</li>
              <li>Express Intent</li>
              <li>Minimalistic</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              These are prioritized. If your code doesn’t work (rule 1) then
              everything else is forfeit. Go back to rule one and get the code
              working before worrying about anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years the community have debated whether the priority of
              rules 2 and 3 should be reversed. Some say a little duplication in
              the code is OK as long as it helps express intent. I’ve debated it
              myself.

                >This recent post</a
              >
              got me thinking about this again, hence this post.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              I don’t think it is fair to compare “Expressing Intent” against
              “DRY”. This is a comparison of apples to oranges. “Expressing
              Intent” is a principle of code quality. “Repeating Yourself” is a
              code smell. A code smell is merely an indicator that there
              <u><em>might</em></u> be something wrong with the code. It takes
              further investigation to determine if a violation of an underlying
              principle of code quality has actually occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example “using nouns for method names”, “using verbs for
              property names”, or “using Booleans for parameters” are all code
              smells that indicate that code probably isn’t doing a good job at
              expressing intent. They are usually very good indicators. But what
              principle is the code smell of Duplication pointing to and how
              good of an indicator is it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Duplication in the code base is bad for a couple reasons. If you
              need to make a change and that needs to be made in a number of
              locations it is difficult to know if you have caught all of them.
              This can lead to bugs if/when one of those locations is
              overlooked. By refactoring the code to remove all duplication
              there will be left with only one place to change, thereby
              eliminating this problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              With most projects the code becomes the single source of truth for
              a project. If a production code base is inconsistent with a five
              year old requirements or design document the production code that
              people are currently living with is usually declared as the
              current reality (or truth). Requirement or design documents at
              this age in a project life cycle are usually of little value.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although comparing production code to external documentation is
              usually straight forward, duplication within the code base muddles
              this declaration of truth. When code is duplicated small
              discrepancies will creep in between the two copies over time. The
              question then becomes which copy is correct? As different factions
              debate how the software should work, trust in the software and the
              team behind it erodes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The code smell of Duplication points to a violation of the
              “<strong>Single Source of Truth” principle</strong>. Let me define
              that as:
            </p>
            <p class="lead mx-md-5 mx-2">
              A stakeholder’s requirement for a software change should never
              cause more than one class to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Violation of the Single Source of Truth principle will always
              result in duplication in the code. However, the inverse is not
              always true. Duplication in the code does not necessarily indicate
              that there is a violation of the Single Source of Truth principle.
            </p>
            <p>
              To illustrate this, let’s look at a retail system where the system
              will (1) send a transaction to a bank and (2) print a receipt for
              the customer. Although these are two separate features of the
              system, they are closely related. The reason for printing the
              receipt is usually to provide an audit trail back to the bank
              transaction. Both features use the same data: amount charged,
              account number, transaction date, customer name, retail store
              name, and etcetera. Because both features use much of the same
              data, there is likely to be a lot of duplication between them.
              This duplication can be removed by making both features use the
              same data access layer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then start coming the divergent requirements. The receipt
              stakeholder wants a change so that the account number has the last
              few digits masked out to protect the customer’s privacy. That can
              be solved with a small IF statement whilst still eliminating all
              duplication in the system. Then the bank wants to take a picture
              of the customer as well as capture their signature and/or PIN
              number for enhanced security. Then the receipt owner wants to pull
              data from a completely different system to report the customer’s
              loyalty program point total.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a while you realize that the two stakeholders have somewhat
              similar, but ultimately different responsibilities. They have
              their own reasons for pulling the data access layer in different
              directions. Then it dawns on you, the
              <strong
                ><a
                  href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf"
                  >Single Responsibility Principle</a
                ></strong
              >:
            </p>
            <p class="lead mx-md-5 mx-2">
              There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this example we have two stakeholders giving two separate
              reasons for the data access class to change. It is clear violation
              of the Single Responsibility Principle. That’s a problem because
              it can often lead the project owner pitting the two stakeholders
              against each other in a vein attempt to get them to work out a
              mutual single source of truth. But that doesn’t exist. There are
              two completely valid truths that the developers need to support.
              How is this to be supported and honour the Single Responsibility
              Principle? The solution is to duplicate the data access layer and
              let each stakeholder control their own copy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Single Source of Truth and Single Responsibility Principles
              are very closely related. SST tells you when to remove
              duplication; SRP tells you when to introduce it. They may seem to
              be fighting each other, but really they are not. The key is to
              clearly identify the different responsibilities (or sources of
              truth) over a system. Sometimes there is a single person with that
              responsibility, other times there are many. This can be especially
              difficult if the same person has dual responsibilities. They might
              not even realize they are wearing multiple hats.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my opinion Single Source of Truth should be listed as the
              second rule of simple design with Express Intent at number three.
              Investigation of the DRY code smell should yield to the proper
              application SST, without violating SRP. When necessary leave
              duplication in the system and let the class names express the
              different people that are responsible for controlling them.
              Knowing all the people with responsibilities over a system is the
              higher priority because you’ll need to know this before you can
              express it. Although it may be a code smell when there is
              duplication in the code, it does not necessarily mean that the
              coder has chosen to be expressive over DRY or that the code is
              bad.
