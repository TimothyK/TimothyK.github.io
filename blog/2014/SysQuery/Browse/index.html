              The Object Explorer (F8) in SQL Server Management Studio is quite
              limiting when you need to search for a table or column. In fact,
              there are no search capabilities at all. All you can do with the
              simple tree user interface is drill down, scroll and scan through
              the tables and columns. You have to navigate to different nodes in
              the tree and/or open popup windows if you what to see the column
              names, default values, or indexes.
            </p>
            <p>
              System queries to the rescue! I've written (and tweaked over the
              years) a small query against the system tables that allows me to
              easily search a database for any table or column name. The results
              show a list of all tables and columns matching the search criteria
              along with data type, null constraint, index and foreign key
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t even use the Object Explorer any more. Instead I just use
              this query. It is a saved file I have on my machine, which I pin
              to the taskbar. Most days I just use this query and the Object
              Explorer never gets opened. I prevent the Object Explorer from
              opening automatically by the Tool-Options-Environment-Startup
              settings.
            </p>
            <p>So here is the query:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/TimothyK/9040368.js?file-columnsearch-sql"></script>

            <p>
              Once the query is open and I point to the correct database
              (Ctrl+U) then enter the table or column name filter values. They
              are wildcard searches so that I can search for any part of the
              table or column name.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally I’ll only enter a table name to search on, then F5 to
              run it. The query results will report the full table definition.
              If the results are too long, or its just easier to do, I’ll use
              the column name filter.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are few commented out filters that I like to keep handy. The
              first limits the query to report only primary keys. The second
              searches for just date columns or bit columns. The last commented
              out filter searches for foreign key children that reference a
              table or column.
            </p>
            <p>
              The columns in the query report table and column name, SQL Server
              data type, and the null constraint. Also the default value for the
              column is reported. If the column is an Identity, the value
              “=Identity” is displayed in the Default column. Calculated columns
              also are displayed in the Default column with a “=” prefix and the
              calculation definition.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result set also has a column for the index the column belongs
              to. If the column’s index is a primary key the value “PK” appears
              in the Index column. Otherwise the index will reported as “IX2”,
              “IX3”, and so on for all the indexes defined on the table. Unique
              indexes get reported with “UQ” instead of “IX”. If the column is a
              member of a composite index the index marker will be followed by a
              dash and the position number of the column in the index. For
              example an Order Line Item table may have the primary key columns
              OrderID and LineItemID, which would be marked with “PK-1” and
              “PK-2” respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a side note, I think it is really critical that the tool you
              use to discover what columns exist in the database report any
              indexes defined against them. The first step in query performance
              tuning is to ensure that the columns you are using to filter on do
              belong to an index. That is why this query reports indexes along
              with column definitions as if they are first class properties of
              the column.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last column is the foreign key. The table and column name of
              the parent column being referenced is reported.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that database columns (i.e. rows in the result set) can be
              reported duplicate times if they belong to multiple indexes or
              foreign keys. Maybe I’ll get around to fixing that one day.
            </p>
            <p>
              This query work great for quick searches of columns in a database.
              However, this is just a starting point. I will often modify the
              this query adding extra nested filters or new columns. This column
              search query is a gateway script that can be leveraged to do much
              more powerful things using the system tables.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example there is a commented out column in the select clause
              to report the .NET framework’s CLR type instead of the SQL Server
              data type. I will often uncomment this and append a space, the
              column name, and a semicolon to create quick field or property
              definitions in C# classes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will also routinely use this to generate SQL scripts to drop or
              rebuild default constraints, indexes or foreign keys. For example,
              I’ll add the following column to the select list to generate
              script to drop Default Constraints in the database: “'Alter Table
              ' + obj.name + ' Drop Constraint ' + def.name”.
            </p>
            <p>
              System queries are a really powerful tool to have in your tool
              belt to work effectively with SQL Server (or any relational)
              database system. I hope you find this query not only helpful for
              column searching, but also to learn and build system queries of
              your own.
