          <main id="post">
            <p>
              In my
              <a href="../WhatIs/">previous post</a>
              I stated that NuGet solves a number of problems when working with
              open source libraries. These problems were finding, downloading,
              controlling, referencing, upgrading and managing dependencies of
              those libraries. These problems aren’t limited to open source or
              third party libraries. These problems also exist with the internal
              libraries you produce. NuGet can solve these problems in an
              internal context as well.
            </p>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">What’s in a Package</div>
              <p>
                Before we create a package lets take a look at what a package is
                and what it contains. In my
                <a href="../WhatIs/">previous post</a>
                I mentioned that a NuGet package is a “.nupkg” file that the
                downloader will put in the MySolution\packages\PackageID.version
                folder.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the file extension, this file is actually a common ZIP
                file. You can rename it with the ZIP extension and decompress it
                as normal. If you do this there are two important artifacts that
                you’ll find in there: a “.nuspec” file and a lib and/or content
                folder.
              </p>
              <p>
                The nuspec file is an XML file. This contains all the metadata
                about the package. It contains the unique NuGet ID, version
                number, title, tags, description, license, and dependency
                information. When you are viewing the package in the “Manage
                NuGet Packages” screen (see
                <a href="../WhatIs/">previous post</a>) you’ll notice that all
                the detail information displayed on the right hand side is
                hosted within this nuspec file.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second artefact(s) in the nupkg file is the lib and/or
                content folders. The lib folder contains any DLLs that should be
                referenced by the projects that install the package. The content
                folder contains any code files that should be added to the
                projects that install the package. Any subfolder structure under
                the content folder will be carried into the project when the
                code files are installed.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Create a Package</div>
              <p>
                As you may have guessed to create a NuGet package you’ll need to
                create a nuspec file. Sure you can copy and edit an existing
                file, but there is an easier way. Download the
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer"
                  >NuGet Package Explorer here</a
                >. This tool will let you easily create a nuspec file and nupkg
                file. It also lets you open existing packages from your computer
                or from an online feed. Let’s open this up and create a new
                package.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                  title="PackageExplorer"
                  alt="PackageExplorer"
                  src="PackageExplorer_2.png"
                  style="max-width: 100%"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                On the left is the package metadata. There are two buttons in
                the tool bar. The Edit button on the left goes into a nice form
                driven UI to edit all the properties. The Angle Brackets button
                on the right lets you look at or edit the raw nuspec XML data.
                Let’s go into the edit mode and look at the important
                properties. The required properties will be in bold.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Id is the unique ID for this package. The Version identifies
                the version of the package. It is important that a
                <a
                  href="http://haacked.com/archive/2011/10/24/semver-nuget-nightly-builds.aspx/"
                  >semantic versioning strategy</a
                >
                is used so that NuGet can properly manage the order of releases
                and recommend upgrades appropriately. To offer an upgrade
                increment the version number, but leave the same Id value.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enter in Title, Author, Description and License as desired. The
                Tags field is a space separated list of keywords that can help
                with searching by end users from the Manage NuGet Packages
                dialog in Visual Studio.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next is dependencies. You can have dependencies on libraries
                contained in the .NET Framework or other NuGet packages.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a lot of DLLs available in the .NET framework, but
                there is no guarantees to which one the people installing your
                package have already referenced in their project. If your
                library depends on one of those framework assemblies you can
                tell NuGet to reference that DLL when installing your package if
                it isn’t already.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may also reference other NuGet packages. Do this by clicking
                the “Edit dependencies” button while in edit mode. Add a group
                (I’m not going to go into framework targeting in this post),
                then click the little properties icon to add a dependency from a
                NuGet feed. Click on the package and hit the “open” hyperlink to
                add it. The version you choose will be the minimum version
                required. You can specify a
                <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/versioning"
                  >version range</a
                >
                for the package if you wish.
              </p>
              <p>
                Last comes the contents. This is on the right pane. Use the
                CONTENT menu at the top to add either a content or lib folder.
                You can also add subfolders to the “content” folder. Use the
                menus to add your code files or DLLs to the package or simply
                drag and drop them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last step is to simply save the package (Ctrl+S). This saves
                everything into a nupkg file.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">Publishing Packages</div>
              <p>
                So now that we have a package this next step is let people have
                access to it. There are a few options on how to do this.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can make your package publically available by uploading it
                to the
                <a href="http://www.nuget.org">nuget.org</a> web site. You’ll
                need to create an account in order to do this. I’m not going to
                cover this in this post.
              </p>
              <p>
                What if you don’t want to make your package publically
                available; what if you only want to make it available internally
                to your own company. There are options for this. The nuget.org
                site is completely open source. You can
                <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery">download</a>
                this full web site and stand it up on your own servers.
                Alternatively you can
                <a
                  href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/Creating-Packages/Hosting-Your-Own-NuGet-Feeds#Creating_Remote_Feeds"
                  >install a web service</a
                >
                that manages packages similar to nuget.org. These installations
                will handle security, give you download counts, and host the
                packages in an OData feed.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the simplest way to set up an internal NuGet feed is
                simply to drop the nupkg files on a file share. It doesn’t have
                the bells and whistles of a web service, but its simple and it
                works.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you’ve created your NuGet feed, developers can access it
                through Visual Studio just like the nuget.org or Microsoft
                feeds. On the “Manage NuGet Packages” screen in the bottom left
                is a “Settings” button. This takes you to the Visual Studio
                Tools-Options-Package Manager-Package Sources page. Here you can
                add new feeds to the NuGet package manager. Simply add the UNC
                path of the file share with your NuGet packages and you are off
                and running.

              <div class="section-header">Automating Package Creation</div>
              <p>
                Above is described the manual process of using the NuGet Package
                Explorer to create a nuspec and nupkg file. It is of course
                possible to automate this process as new versions of your
                package are built. This is done using the same
                <a href="https://www.nuget.org/downloads">NuGet.exe</a>
                file described in my
                <a href="../WhatIs/">previous post</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                For your version 1.0.0 release you’d create the nuspec file
                using the NuGet Package Explorer. Place this file in an empty
                directory. Then add a content or lib subfolder and add the code
                files or DLLs to be included in the package. Then it is a simple
                command line call to nuget.exe to build the nupkg file.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that the nuspec file contains the version number to assign
                to the package. This can be problematic to update from an
                automated build process. Thankfully, the nuget.exe program
                provides a command line option so that the version number can be
                overridden.
              </p>
              <p>The full call is:</p>
              <code>
                <pre>
  nuget.exe pack "C:\Path\MyLib.nuspec" -Version 1.0.1</pre
                >
              </code>
            </section>

            <p>
              Hopefully that’s enough information to get you started creating
              some simple packages. There are a lot more features available,
              such as targeting different frameworks, injecting or transforming
              app.config files, or working with the Package Manager Console. For
              further reading please check out the
