            <p>
              SQL Server has a built-in data type that automatically marks
              changes to rows. This data type is “rowversion”. Formerly this
              data type was named “timestamp”, and Microsoft recommends you
              start using the new name. This data type can be used for 2 main
              purposes: optimistic record locking and data queue processing.
            </p>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">What is it?</div>
              <p>Before getting to how it is used, let’s look at what it is.</p>
              <p>
                Row version is a read-only column that SQL Server will update
                for you automatically, as if by trigger. You cannot insert or
                update into this column. Also, you may only have one rowversion
                column per table.
              </p>
              <p>
                The value of the column is (more or less) a number. It will
                automatically increment itself by one each time the row is
                modified. The number will be unique for every row. So if you do
                an Update SQL statement that updates 3 rows, the rowversion
                field values will have 3 unique, sequential values. The numbers
                are unique with respect to the database name.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, the rowversion column is actually a binary(8)
                field. These eight bytes can be thought of as a unsigned 64-bit
                integer.
              </p>
              <p>Let’s start by creating a table with a rowversion column.</p>
              <code>
                <pre>
    Create Table Orders (
      OrderID int not null identity(1,1)
          Constraint PK_Orders Primary Key
      , ProductName varchar(50) not null
      , Quantity int not null
      , RowRevision rowversion
    )
  </pre
                >
              </code>

              <p>Next let’s insert a row.</p>

              <code>
                <pre>
    Insert Into Orders(ProductName, Quantity)
    Values ('Widget-Dongles', 13)
  </pre
                >
              </code>

              <p>Then we query the table.</p>

              <p>
                <img alt="SSMS" src="ssms_rowversion.png" />
              </p>

              <p>
                If you were to update the row, the RowRevision column would
                increment.
              </p>

              <p>
                The values reported by the rowversion column can be converted to
                literal values and used in SQL statements. The literal value can
                be defined using the binary (hexadecimal) value or its
                equivalent value converted to a decimal integer. You can use the
                standard equality operator. Note that if using the binary syntax
                you must have the correct number of leading zeros.
              </p>

              <code>
                <pre>
    Select * 
    From Orders 
    Where RowRevision = 0x000000000000ABE2 
  
    Select * 
    From Orders 
    Where RowRevision = 44002
              </pre
                >
              </code>

              <p>
                There is one more thing to know when working with rowversion
                column. SQL Server has a function that will return the last
                rowversion value that it assigned to a row. That function is
                called <code>@@DBTS</code>.
              </p>

              <code>
                <pre>
    Select @@DBTS
  </pre
                >
              </code>
            </section>

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Optimistic Record Locking</div>

              <p>
                So let’s stay you want to allow users to manually edit records
                on a form. With this type of application there will be an
                implied behaviour as to what happens when two users attempt to
                update the same record at the same time. These behaviours fall
                into 1 of 3 general patterns: pessimistic locking, no locking,
                and optimistic locking.
              </p>

              <p>
                Pessimistic locking can be used when the desired behaviour is
                that other users are blocked after the first user opens the
                record for editing. The second user gets a good error message
                saying why they aren’t allowed to edit the record at this time.
                This is typically implemented by the first process writing to a
                special field that represents the lock. For example,
                <code>
                  Update Order Set LockedBy = ‘Tim’ Where OrderID = 1 </code
                >. Only the user that holds the lock may edit the record. It is
                usually best to make sure there is some kind of timeout is built
                into the algorithm so that the lock cannot be held for days at a
                time. Also, having a privilege to allow an Admin to release a
                lock may be beneficial. Instead of implementing this with a lock
                column in the table, a database transaction could be used
                instead. Because the lock will block all other users in the
                system, this can be a serious disadvantage in systems that need
                to scale.
              </p>

              <p>
                The “no record locking” strategy is to simply allow the last
                person to save the record win. Users will not be alerted to the
                fact that one of their colleagues is also modifying the same
                record at the same time. Although this scales well to have a
                large number of users, confusion can ensue when the changes one
                user made to a record appear to get reverted.
              </p>

              <p>
                Optimistic record locking, like pessimistic, will not allow
                multiple users to edit the same record at the same time. However
                with optimistic locking, the check is not done until attempting
                to save the data. This is different than pessimistic where the
                record is blocked from even being loaded in edit mode.
                Optimistic locking will allow multiple users to open the record
                in edit mode, assuming (optimistically) that most users will
                simply cancel or make no changes (they are using the edit screen
                to simply view the details of the record).
              </p>

              <p>
                Optimistic record locking relies on a version column to be added
                to the table. Every update to row must change the value in this
                version field. When displaying the record on the edit screen the
                entire record is loaded, including its version. If the user
                changes fields on the screen the record is saved. While saving
                the program will change the version field value automatically.
                Also, during the save the program will verify that the version
                field value currently in the database is the exact same value as
                when the current user first loaded the record. If the version
                field value has changed, then another user must have changed
                this and the current user’s changes are cancelled.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have seen various strategies for attempting to manually update
                a version column in each application. These strategies have used
                varchar, datetime, or int data types for the version column.
                However it is best just to use a rowversion column and let SQL
                Server ensure that this value is incremented correctly. Why
                implement manually what the database can do for you
                automatically?
              </p>

              <p>
                For the tables you want to implement an optimistic record
                locking strategy on, simply add a rowversion column. When
                updating the records add the rowversion column as a term in the
                Where clause along with the primary key. If another user has
                modified the row the update statement will update zero rows. If
                this occurs you can inform your user that another user has
                modified or delete the record. Hopefully that will be unlikely,
                after all we are being optimistic.
              </p>

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Data Processing Queues</div>

              <p>
                Another way I often use rowversion columns is to build data
                processing queues. Let’s say the NSA comes to you with a new
                requirement that they want reported to them all orders where
                exactly 13 Widget-Dongles were purchased. The problem with this
                requirement is that you don’t have a database index on the
                Orders table to quickly identify orders that match this
                criteria. Also you’d need to add a ReportedToNSA column to your
                table to track records that have been reported.
              </p>

              <p>
                You could add these indexes and flags to the database, but this
                is just one requirement. Different users will have a wide
                variety of requirements. After a while the database will get
                very messy with an index and flag being added for every
                requirement.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another strategy can be used to implement this is to leverage a
                rowversion column. This column will need to be indexed (which by
                the way is not required for optimistic record locking).
              </p>

              <p>
                Each data processing queue (i.e. requirement) would persist a
                pointer to the rowversion column. For example the “NSA 13
                Widget-Dongle” requirement would have a pointer value of
                0x000000000000ABE2. The algorithm knows that any records in the
                Orders table with 13 Widget Dongles that have a RowRevision
                value of less that or equal to this value have already been
                reported to the NSA. When the algorithm wants to query the
                Orders table for new records that might need to be reported, it
                only need to look at records with a RowRevision greater than
                this value. Whenever an order is added or modified in the table,
                the algorithm will find it. Even if there are millions of rows
                in the Orders table, the algorithm uses a database index that
                will limit the search to only the few new rows.
              </p>

              <p>
                The basic algorithm to implement this data queue is as follows:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Read your current pointer position.</li>

                <li>
                  Read the current row version value from the database (<code
                    >Select @@DBTS</code
                  >)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Query the Orders table where RowRevision is greater than the
                  current pointer position and filtering with respect to the
                  business rule requirement (e.g. Quantity = 13 and ProductName
                  = ‘Widget-Dongles’). Order the results by RowRevision
                  ascending.
                </li>

                <li>
                  For each record found, process it (e.g. report it to the NSA).
                  Then update the stored current pointer position (read in step
                  #1) to the current RowRevision value of the record that was
                  just processed.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Once all records are processed (even if zero were) update the
                  current pointer position with the value read in step #2. This
                  ensures that the algorithm will only scan the Orders table
                  once.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Storing the current pointer positions can be done in another
                table. This will be a simple key value pair table. The values
                (current pointer position) column should have the data type
                binary(8). This is the same data type as what is returned by the
                <code>@@DBTS</code> function and the rowversion column’s
                underlying type.
              </p>

              <p>
                The “processing” done by the algorithm can be anything. A very
                common use case is to replicate the record to another system.
                The same algorithm can be used to replicate all rows in a table.
                To replicate all rows, just remove the business rule filtering
                from the algorithm.
