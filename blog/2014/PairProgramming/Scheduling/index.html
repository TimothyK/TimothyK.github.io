              This second of three posts on Pair Programming. The
              <a href="../Benefits/">first post</a>
              described why pair programming is a good idea. I’m going to assume
              you’ve read that and now you want to start pair programming on
              your team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wanting to do pair programing and actually doing pair programming
              are two different things. It would be an over simplification to
              say that the way to start pair programming is to simply “start
              pairing”. Its like saying to lose weight, simply eat less and
              exercise more. There are usually other factors in play and it
              takes disciplined approach to get over the initial hurdle so that
              pairing is part of your routine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Logistically, it does take a little bit of effort to plan a
              pairing session. A task to pair on must be identified, the two
              developers to be paired must be assigned, and a mutually
              acceptable time for the session must be planned.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides these logistics issues, there is cultural change that
              needs to occur. If you’re not doing pairing now, you’re probably
              in the habit where every developer comes in the morning, goes to
              their cube, and stays there silent for most of the day. They
              actively try to avoid interrupting their colleagues. They may
              believe that less talk and more person-hours typing is the key to
              productivity. These habits and attitudes need to be broken.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m going to describe three different approaches for getting over
              this initial hurdle and start to regularly pair. These approaches
              are: Shadowing, Stand-ups and Round Robin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I get to the approaches, I’ll first talk about choosing a
              partner. If you want to skip over that section the TL;DR version
              is that any two developers should be able to successfully pair
              together. However, various types of pairing can lead to different
              dynamics. The Choose a Partner section describes the dynamics and
              benefits of each pairing type. If you have specific goals in mind,
              choosing the correct pair may be a factor.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Choose a Partner</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              In a <b>typical, Complementary Pairing</b> each person will
              <b>give</b> <b>expertise</b> in one area and <b>receive</b>
              <b>training</b> in another. Multiple skills are required to
              complete any task. The pair should complement each other whereby
              the weaknesses of one individual are the strengths of the other
              and vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example when integrating a new DLL into an existing program
              the developer(s) working on the task must have some knowledge
              about the new DLL and some knowledge about the existing code base
              to be modified. A good pairing would be someone familiar with the
              existing code base paired with someone that has worked on (or
              with) the DLL before. The expert on the existing code base will
              get up to speed with the new DLL very quickly. The DLL expert gets
              exposure to other parts of the system. Also, the DLL expert
              increases their own expertise by receiving feedback on consumption
              of their DLL. This may lead to enhancements to the DLL or
              libraries that make it easier to consume in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Expert-Novice</b> pairings are usually done to train new
              employees. They are also very common in teams that have low bus
              numbers. It is best to work on tasks that aren’t too complicated
              so that the novice isn’t too overwhelmed and can is able to
              contribute some code. Obviously, in this scenario the novice
              benefits from the pairing session by receiving training. The
              expert also benefits because the simple act of tutoring often
              increases the expert’s expertise. The expert also gets an
              opportunity to work on their soft skills and team building.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Expert-Expert</b> pairings are able to take on insanely
              difficult tasks. They can solve problems that would be too
              intimidating for a single person.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Novice-Novice</b> pairings are beneficial even in the absence
              of an expert. Analogies to “the blind leading the blind” are a
              myth. Solo novices can often waste hours on little problems that
              can be easily solved by asking any other team member. Novice pairs
              spend far less time being stuck. If they both are stuck they are
              confident in knowing “it’s not them” and seek the help of an
              expert. Also novice pairing can be excellent for gaining
              confidence as at least one will have to pretend to be the expert.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pairing does not have to be limited to new coding tasks.
              Maintenance or hot fix coding, working on support calls, R &amp;
              D, design tasks, or
              <b>most other development work can be paired on</b>. Also
              <b>tedious tasks</b> can be occasionally paired on. You may think
              that every developer does this task every day and it only takes 5
              minutes so it isn’t worth pairing on. Don’t assume everyone knows
              the fastest way to get something done. Other developers might be
              using tools that take them an order of magnitude faster or slower
              on the same task. Also tedious tasks are usually error prone and
              can often use an extra set of eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is best to <b>rotate</b> partners frequently. Don’t pair with
              the same person day in and day out. Switching partners frequently
              maximizes the spread of knowledge in the team.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Shadowing</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Shadowing is where one person is assigned another. This approach
              is typically used with new hires. The new hire is<strong>
                assigned to another developer for mentoring</strong
              >. The new hire will learn everything they need to know about
              their new company by performing the daily tasks with a colleague.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shadowing is probably the easiest approach to implement. There are
              fewer cultural barriers here. Even if your team doesn’t do pair
              programming currently, it probably still does one-on-one training
              for new hires. The new hire is also more open to new ideas; they
              don’t have any bad habits that need to be broken. If you tell them
              from day one that they are expected to work as a team they may
              actually do that as opposed to telling the same thing to an
              existing employee set in their ways.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Stand-up</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              The daily stand-up meeting is where each team member states what
              tasks they are working on an obstacles they are facing. The
              obstacles are usually something they need help with. If your not
              doing stand-ups then there is probably some other mechanism you
              have in place to keep in touch with your colleague’s daily tasks
              (kanban boards,
              <a href="https://campfirenow.com/">chat rooms</a>,
              <a href="https://idonethis.com/">daily reports</a>, or various
              other dashboard tools).
            </p>
            <p>
              These discussion forums give an opportunity to schedule pair
              programming sessions. If colleague is assigned a task you think
              you could help with, volunteer to pair on it. If you think you
              could benefit from someone else’s help on your task, ask for a
              pairing session. Just add a
              <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/threeqs.html"
                >fourth question</a
              >
              to your daily stand-up of “<strong
                >who can I pair with today?</strong
              >”
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Round Robin</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              The last approach I’ll present for getting pairing sessions going
              is Round Robin. This a top down management mandate to force
              developers to give pairing a try. This approach doesn’t exactly
              fit with the typical grass roots capital-A Agile approaches teams
              usually prefer. However, sometimes an extreme approach like this
              can be effective at changing habits and trying new things.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach works best when you have a small team that should be
              <strong>cross-functional</strong>. This is where you want every
              team member to be familiar with all other aspects of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under this approach pair programming can be introduced slowly and
              be implemented on a trial basis. It<strong>
                lets sceptics see how pairing works</strong
              >, while giving them
              <strong>strict control of the hours </strong>dedicated to the
              experiment. It can start with only a couple 60-90 minute sessions
              per developer per week. As both developers and managers start
              seeing the benefits of the sessions, more can be added as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach removes the demand on developers for asking to
              receive or volunteering to give help. This barrier is replaced
              with fixed assignments. The
              <b>partners will be assigned</b> each week. Assignments will be
              done in a round-robin that will be rotated each week. For example
              here is a monthly schedule of pairs for a team of 5 members.

            <p>
              During the first week Eric will spend 60-90 minutes at Alice’s
              desk working as a pair on one of Alice’s assigned tasks. Also, at
              a different time during the same week Alice will pair with Bob on
              one of Bob’s tasks. Therefore each developer participates in
              <b>two pairing sessions per week</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rotation schedule can accommodate a team of any size. If
              desired, a slot could be added for a “foreign exchange developer”
              to introduce a few cross-team sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Team members are responsible for
              <b>scheduling their own pairing sessions</b>. Negotiation of this
              starts with the task owner suggesting a time to whoever is helping
              them that week. It is best to make the planning of the pairing
              session into a habit. Every Monday morning at 9:00 take 2 minutes
              to schedule the session.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, contact between team members is not limited to these
              pairing sessions. Some tasks may benefit from a specific pairing.
              If that pairing is not on the schedule for weeks, don’t let that
              stop you. <b>More pairing sessions can be added as needed</b>.
