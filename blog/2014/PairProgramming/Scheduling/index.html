            <p>
              This second of three posts on Pair Programming. The
              <a href="../Benefits/">first post</a>
              described why pair programming is a good idea. I’m going to assume
              you’ve read that and now you want to start pair programming on
              your team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wanting to do pair programing and actually doing pair programming
              are two different things. It would be an over simplification to
              say that the way to start pair programming is to simply “start
              pairing”. Its like saying to lose weight, simply eat less and
              exercise more. There are usually other factors in play and it
              takes disciplined approach to get over the initial hurdle so that
              pairing is part of your routine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Logistically, it does take a little bit of effort to plan a
              pairing session. A task to pair on must be identified, the two
              developers to be paired must be assigned, and a mutually
              acceptable time for the session must be planned.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides these logistics issues, there is cultural change that
              needs to occur. If you’re not doing pairing now, you’re probably
              in the habit where every developer comes in the morning, goes to
              their cube, and stays there silent for most of the day. They
              actively try to avoid interrupting their colleagues. They may
              believe that less talk and more person-hours typing is the key to
              productivity. These habits and attitudes need to be broken.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m going to describe three different approaches for getting over
              this initial hurdle and start to regularly pair. These approaches
              are: Shadowing, Stand-ups and Round Robin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I get to the approaches, I’ll first talk about choosing a
              partner. If you want to skip over that section the TL;DR version
              is that any two developers should be able to successfully pair
              together. However, various types of pairing can lead to different
              dynamics. The Choose a Partner section describes the dynamics and
              benefits of each pairing type. If you have specific goals in mind,
              choosing the correct pair may be a factor.
            </p>

                In a
                <span class="skim-focus">typical, Complementary Pairing</span>
                each person will <span class="skim-focus">give</span>
                <span class="skim-focus">expertise</span> in one area and
                <span class="skim-focus">receive</span>
                <span class="skim-focus">training</span> in another. Multiple
                skills are required to complete any task. The pair should
                complement each other whereby the weaknesses of one individual
                are the strengths of the other and vice versa.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example when integrating a new DLL into an existing program
                the developer(s) working on the task must have some knowledge
                about the new DLL and some knowledge about the existing code
                base to be modified. A good pairing would be someone familiar
                with the existing code base paired with someone that has worked
                on (or with) the DLL before. The expert on the existing code
                base will get up to speed with the new DLL very quickly. The DLL
                expert gets exposure to other parts of the system. Also, the DLL
                expert increases their own expertise by receiving feedback on
                consumption of their DLL. This may lead to enhancements to the
                DLL or libraries that make it easier to consume in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="skim-focus">Expert-Novice</span> pairings are
                usually done to train new employees. They are also very common
                in teams that have low bus numbers. It is best to work on tasks
                that aren’t too complicated so that the novice isn’t too
                overwhelmed and can is able to contribute some code. Obviously,
                in this scenario the novice benefits from the pairing session by
                receiving training. The expert also benefits because the simple
                act of tutoring often increases the expert’s expertise. The
                expert also gets an opportunity to work on their soft skills and
                team building.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="skim-focus">Expert-Expert</span> pairings are able
                to take on insanely difficult tasks. They can solve problems
                that would be too intimidating for a single person.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="skim-focus">Novice-Novice</span> pairings are
                beneficial even in the absence of an expert. Analogies to “the
                blind leading the blind” are a myth. Solo novices can often
                waste hours on little problems that can be easily solved by
                asking any other team member. Novice pairs spend far less time
                being stuck. If they both are stuck they are confident in
                knowing “it’s not them” and seek the help of an expert. Also
                novice pairing can be excellent for gaining confidence as at
                least one will have to pretend to be the expert.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pairing does not have to be limited to new coding tasks.
                Maintenance or hot fix coding, working on support calls, R &amp;
                D, design tasks, or
                <span class="skim-focus"
                  >most other development work can be paired on</span
                >. Also <span class="skim-focus">tedious tasks</span> can be
                occasionally paired on. You may think that every developer does
                this task every day and it only takes 5 minutes so it isn’t
                worth pairing on. Don’t assume everyone knows the fastest way to
                get something done. Other developers might be using tools that
                take them an order of magnitude faster or slower on the same
                task. Also tedious tasks are usually error prone and can often
                use an extra set of eyes.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is best to <span class="skim-focus">rotate</span> partners
                frequently. Don’t pair with the same person day in and day out.
                Switching partners frequently maximizes the spread of knowledge
                in the team.

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Shadowing</div>

              <p>
                Shadowing is where one person is assigned another. This approach
                is typically used with new hires. The new hire is<span
                  class="skim-focus"
                >
                  assigned to another developer for mentoring</span
                >. The new hire will learn everything they need to know about
                their new company by performing the daily tasks with a
                colleague.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shadowing is probably the easiest approach to implement. There
                are fewer cultural barriers here. Even if your team doesn’t do
                pair programming currently, it probably still does one-on-one
                training for new hires. The new hire is also more open to new
                ideas; they don’t have any bad habits that need to be broken. If
                you tell them from day one that they are expected to work as a
                team they may actually do that as opposed to telling the same
                thing to an existing employee set in their ways.
              </p>

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Stand-up</div>

              <p>
                The daily stand-up meeting is where each team member states what
                tasks they are working on an obstacles they are facing. The
                obstacles are usually something they need help with. If your not
                doing stand-ups then there is probably some other mechanism you
                have in place to keep in touch with your colleague’s daily tasks
                (kanban boards,
                <a href="https://campfirenow.com/">chat rooms</a>,
                <a href="https://idonethis.com/">daily reports</a>, or various
                other dashboard tools).
              </p>
              <p>
                These discussion forums give an opportunity to schedule pair
                programming sessions. If colleague is assigned a task you think
                you could help with, volunteer to pair on it. If you think you
                could benefit from someone else’s help on your task, ask for a
                pairing session. Just add a
                <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/threeqs.html"
                  >fourth question</a
                >
                to your daily stand-up of “<span class="skim-focus"
                  >who can I pair with today?</span
                >”
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Round Robin</div>
              <p>
                The last approach I’ll present for getting pairing sessions
                going is Round Robin. This a top down management mandate to
                force developers to give pairing a try. This approach doesn’t
                exactly fit with the typical grass roots capital-A Agile
                approaches teams usually prefer. However, sometimes an extreme
                approach like this can be effective at changing habits and
                trying new things.
              </p>
              <p>
                This approach works best when you have a small team that should
                be
                <span class="skim-focus">cross-functional</span>. This is where
                you want every team member to be familiar with all other aspects
                of the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under this approach pair programming can be introduced slowly
                and be implemented on a trial basis. It<span class="skim-focus">
                  lets sceptics see how pairing works</span
                >, while giving them
                <span class="skim-focus">strict control of the hours </span
                >dedicated to the experiment. It can start with only a couple
                60-90 minute sessions per developer per week. As both developers
                and managers start seeing the benefits of the sessions, more can
                be added as needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                This approach removes the demand on developers for asking to
                receive or volunteering to give help. This barrier is replaced
                with fixed assignments. The
                <span class="skim-focus">partners will be assigned</span> each
                week. Assignments will be done in a round-robin that will be
                rotated each week. For example here is a monthly schedule of
                pairs for a team of 5 members.

                During the first week Eric will spend 60-90 minutes at Alice’s
                desk working as a pair on one of Alice’s assigned tasks. Also,
                at a different time during the same week Alice will pair with
                Bob on one of Bob’s tasks. Therefore each developer participates
                in
                <span class="skim-focus">two pairing sessions per week</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rotation schedule can accommodate a team of any size. If
                desired, a slot could be added for a “foreign exchange
                developer” to introduce a few cross-team sessions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Team members are responsible for
                <span class="skim-focus"
                  >scheduling their own pairing sessions</span
                >. Negotiation of this starts with the task owner suggesting a
                time to whoever is helping them that week. It is best to make
                the planning of the pairing session into a habit. Every Monday
                morning at 9:00 take 2 minutes to schedule the session.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, contact between team members is not limited to these
                pairing sessions. Some tasks may benefit from a specific
                pairing. If that pairing is not on the schedule for weeks, don’t
                let that stop you.
                <span class="skim-focus"
                  >More pairing sessions can be added as needed</span
                >.
