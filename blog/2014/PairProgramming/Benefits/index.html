            <p>
              So I’m going to do a three posts on Pair Programming. This first
              post discusses, from a business point of view, why Pair
              Programming is a good idea. The next two posts, focused more for
              developers, will be on the implementation details of how to actual
              do pair programming. However, if you’re a developer don’t skip
              ahead. Before taking on any tasks (like pair programming), it is
              <a href="../../../2013/UserStory/IsTheThing/"
                >important to understand the goals</a
              >
              of that task.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Improved Quality</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Studies show that one of the most cost effective ways to
              <b>improve code quality</b> is with <b>code reviews</b>. Code
              reviews are done after the code is written. Often during code
              reviews improvements are suggested, but rarely is the code
              retrofitted to incorporate those suggestions.
              <b>Pair programming has an advantage over code reviews</b> because
              the review process is done before or while the code is being
              written. It is very easy to incorporate suggestions at this time.
              Also, pairing is generally perceived as less judgemental than
              formal code reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pairing can also lead to <b>better software design</b>. Pair
              programming can be like a Texas Scramble/Best Ball golf
              tournament, where the best contribution of all involved is taken.
              The pair has the opportunity to be presented with and discuss
              various alternatives before proceeding. The pair can think up
              <b>more alternatives</b> than a solo developer could. This yields
              improved designs, at the high, medium and low levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pairing gives developers
              <b>reason and courage for improving</b> the code. When a novice,
              solo programmer needs to work on code written by an expert they
              may think there must be valid reasons for why the code is written
              the way it is. Even if the novice thinks the code needs
              improvement they lack the expertise to make the change safely. The
              more likely scenario is the novice will copy the existing coding
              style in the new code they write.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the same task is worked on by a pair, the expert can explain
              to novice that they weren’t really happy with the code in its
              current state. Even if the expert was satisfied with the code at
              the time, when working with the novice they can see through their
              eyes the stumbling points when working on the code. Together the
              pair can agree on which stumbling points are significant, how they
              should be solved, and implement those changes safely.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Lower Development Costs</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              From an economics point of view, pair program has a
              <b>lower cost of development</b>. Some think that having two
              developers work on a task will double the person-hours it takes to
              do the task. Studies show that <u>initial</u> development time is
              only 15% longer or can even be faster. When you factor in the work
              required to do hot fixes, the improved quality from pairing always
              yields a lower <u>total</u> development time in the long term.
            </p>
            <p>
              The quick development time of the pair often comes from an
              increased <b>focus</b>. Pairing literally is having another person
              looking over your shoulder all time. People actively participating
              in pairing are less likely to be distracted by interruptions (e.g.
              checking email, mind wandering to unrelated tasks, or blankly
              staring at the screen for minutes on end). Even related secondary
              tasks can be blocked out. The person on the keyboard can focus on
              just banging out the code, while the partner can worry out
              readability, testability, robustness, user upgrade migration, and
              other “big picture” issues related to the new code. Working with a
              pair provides positive pressure to stay on task.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quick development times can also be attributed to
              <b>faster debugging times</b>. Having a second set of eyes can
              help find bugs faster.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Pair Learning</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Pair Programming creates a <b>learning environment</b>. Team
              members that are expert in one area will share that knowledge with
              others on the team. There are various areas of expertise that can
              be shared:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Domain – knowledge of the customer’s industry, processes, and
                systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                Model – how we represent that domain knowledge in our code and
                database objects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Code Base – general outline/structure of our code solutions
              </li>
              <li>
                Framework – discovery, usage, and contributing to common code
                (internal and 3<sup>rd</sup> party)
              </li>
              <li>
                Language – proficiency in the programming language, including
                coding standards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tooling – Visual Studio, Resharper, DBMSs, test frameworks,
                source control, scripts
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There are many benefits of Pair Learning. It decreases the risk
              carried by an organization by having only one expert (i.e.
              <b>low </b
              ><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor"
                ><b>bus number</b></a
              >). Pairing dramatically <b>decreases training time</b>,
              especially for new employees. Solo wading through documentation or
              painfully trying to get software to run that you haven’t worked
              with before can be drastically sped up with having an expert on
              hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              The introduction of any new process on an organization will lead
              to a temporary drop in productivity as the new process is being
              adopted. This will be true of pair programming. In the being a lot
              of time will be dedicated learning. Significant time in each
              pairing session will be for solely raising the team’s bus number.
              Discussion of coding standards and tooling may be common. Instead
              of pairing on new code, the session may turn into a review of code
              that has never been previously reviewed. This is a natural part of
              introducing pair programming. As bus numbers increase the pairing
              sessions will shift from learning-based to being focused on
              quickly writing new, high quality code. And this is where the
              eventual productivity increase will come from.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pairing not only leads to learning technical skills, but it also
              <b>improves </b
              ><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills"
                ><b>soft skills</b></a
              >. By practicing in pairing sessions developers learn to
              communication more effectively. Developers learn negotiation
              skills, honing the balance between compromise and standing firm.
              It also improves confidence, which leads to more contributions in
              larger team meetings.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Team Building</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Having pairing sessions several times a week also has a huge
              impact on <b>team building</b>. Pairing frequently is far more
              effective at promoting team building than the odd lunch or “beer
              and wing” night. Pairing leads to <b>trust</b> amongst the team
              members where everyone is aware of each other’s capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Virtually all people that try pair programming state that they
              enjoy it. Human beings are social animals.
              <b>Happy developers</b> are very important to the organization.
              Unhappy developers tend to quit. Hiring and training a new
              developer costs tens of thousands of dollars each time.
            </p>
            <p>
              So that’s all my arguments for pair programming. In my
              <a href="../Scheduling/">next post</a>
              I’ll cover how to get over the first hurdles and begin pairing
              sessions.
