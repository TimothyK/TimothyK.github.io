            <p>
              This is the last in a three part post on pair programming. The
              first posts described the
              <a href="../Benefits/">benefits of pair programing</a>
              and
              <a href="../Scheduling/"
                >how to make pairing part of your routine</a
              >. This last post will cover what is necessary to have a
              successful pairing session.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Workspace Layout</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Let’s start with the <b>workspace layout</b>. Many feel that the
              ideal workspace for pairing is two collocated developers working
              on a single computer. The computer should have a large monitor,
              with two keyboards and mice. Developers should be able to sit
              comfortably side by side at a long straight or slightly convex
              table, as opposed to behind one another. Tools should be identical
              from computer to computer (same OS and software versions, add-ins,
              keyboard shortcuts, and configuration).
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this is just some people’s opinion on the “ideal”.
              Workspace layout is not a critical factor in the success or
              failure of pair programming. Any deficiencies in the workspace can
              be successfully ignored by a focused pair like any other
              distraction. Tooling standardization can be negotiated. Furniture
              changes are possible if/when pairing becomes common place.
              Colocation is increasing becoming a non-issue and the
              <b>remote pairing</b> community has a large number of
              <a href="http://www.pairprogramwith.me/"><b>resources</b></a>
              available to help with that practice.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Roles</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              When it comes to actual pairing most literature describes a
              <b>Driver and Navigator</b> role. The driver works the keyboard
              and mouse. The driver should stay focused on writing the code,
              while the navigator stays a few steps ahead. The navigator tells
              the driver the next line to type in pseudo code shorthand. While
              the driver converts that to syntactically correct code the
              navigator has time to think up the next few lines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another possible dynamic for pairing are
              <b>Driver and Reviewer</b> roles. In this scenario the driver
              takes the lead in thinking up the algorithm they implement. The
              partner is doing a continuous code review. The reviewer points out
              potential bugs, checks for readability and other “big picture”
              issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              The roles should be switched<b> (keyboard passed) frequently</b>.
              This helps with keeping both people fresh and focused. It also
              encourages egalitarianism in the team building. Sometimes when you
              get on a roll, this step can get forgotten. When practicing TDD,
              <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern"
                >ping pong</a
              >
              can be an effective way of triggering these transitions.
            </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Continuous Communication</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              During the session the pair should be
              <b>communicating continuously</b>. This is <b>critical</b> to
              staying focused on the task. Pauses in the conversation of 30
              seconds should be extremely rare and serve as a red flag. Also,
              the conversation must be <b>two-way</b> with both taking turns
              talking. There are numerous ways to keep the conversation going:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The driver or navigator can ask for feedback on what they have
                been writing.
              </li>
              <li>
                The driver can start describing to the reviewer what they are
                doing.
              </li>
              <li>
                The reviewer can ask questions on common code smells (e.g. is
                that a good variable name).
              </li>
              <li>The expert can quiz the trainee.</li>
              <li>Discuss the plan for the next steps.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
              <b><u>Respect &amp; Confidence</u></b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              One of the main advantages of pairing is the exposure to multiple
              alternatives when coding. Therefore, it is important to
              <b>be confident</b> and suggest alternatives. Be open to new ideas
              and allow for some experimentation. Just because something is “not
              the way I would have done it” doesn’t necessarily make it wrong.
              Negotiate for the best solution. Remember to
              <b>be respectful</b> and remember that one of the goals is team
              building. Effective communication isn’t only about being a good
              talker – it’s about listening too.
            </p>
            <p>
              If sessions go over 60-90 minutes, be sure to <b>take breaks</b>.
              Pairing demands a high level of focus for extended periods. This
              can be very draining.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, a concession that pairing isn’t for everyone. The vast
              majority of people that try pairing say they like it. However,
              there are some tasks, pairings, or people that just aren’t suited
              to it. Give it an honest try, but if you are having difficulties
              with pairing let a manager know.
