          <main id="post">
            <p>
              Over the years, from time to time, I have received criticism over
              the release notes I have written. That’s fair, I certainly have
              written some crappy release notes on occasion. However sometimes I
              get the feeling that those criticizing believe that somehow all
              developers, no matter how junior, should be genetically implanted
              at birth with the knowledge of how to always write good release
              notes. Being able to write good release notes, code, or any other
              form of writing is a skill that takes hard work to learn and
              develop. Writing good release notes is hard. In this post I’ll
              cover some of the reasons why it is so hard and some tips to do
              better.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Release notes should
              <span class="skim-focus">sell the product</span> being released.
              There should be a definite marketing aspect to release notes. The
              release notes should make the customer want to buy the product or
              install the upgrade. This can make some developers uncomfortable.
              Their job is to write code, not market the product. To force them
              into this role can make them feel a bit like a whore.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although marketing can feel uncomfortable at first, it is
              something that everyone should get familiar with. Everyone, no
              matter what profession, should be able to explain the value that
              they are providing to both their customers and employers. Being
              able to describe this completes a feedback loop that ensures that
              everyone (the employee, the employer, and the customer) are all
              aware of the value of the services being provided. Not being able
              to describe this is a red flag that you may be delivering the
              wrong thing for the customer.
              <a href="../../2013/UserStory/IsTheThing/">As I’ve said before</a
              >, if you aren’t sure of the value of a work item stop and figure
              that out before continuing.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Release notes should be very short and to the point. They don’t
              even need to be full sentences. They should read more like
              <span class="skim-focus">newspaper headlines</span>. Be sure to
              provide links to bug/enhancement system tracking records, user
              manuals, or feature release blog posts so that anybody can dive
              deeper if they need to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally, there should be
              <span class="skim-focus">symmetry</span> between each point in the
              release notes. You don’t want to list “fixed a spelling error” and
              “new feature that cures cancer” as if they are the same level of
              importance. Minor issues can be grouped together. The individual
              issues can be made available from an external link, collapsible
              region, or indented sub-bullets. When symmetry is not possible,
              lead with the larger issues.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              When writing release notes, or any form of writing, it is
              important to <span class="skim-focus">know the audience</span>.
              Not all issues are going to be important to all users. Group
              issues into sections or separate documents for different readers.
              There are a number of ways to group issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Items can be grouped into bug fixes or enhancements. New users
              aren’t concerned with bug fixes, but users that routinely submit
              bug reports will be interested in the new fixes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes separate public and private release note documents can
              be beneficial. Private release notes can go into more details of
              the technical debt that was cleaned up, which could be plain
              boring to external customers. Although there can be benefits to
              the approach, beware that is can lead to a lack of transparency
              with the customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Really when it comes down to it, grouping issues by audience
              really comes to down to identifying different roles or personas
              within your user base. New or existing users, external or internal
              customers are just some roles. Others can include: casual users,
              power users, system administrators, IT or operations.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Like other writing, release notes will benefit from an editor or
              peer review process.
              <span class="skim-focus">Various people should have input</span>
              on release notes. These are: the programmer, the product manager,
              marketing, and a technical writer. It doesn’t matter which of
              these people is the original author of the release notes, as long
              as the each of these people have their area of expertise
              represented in the final version.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="skim-focus">The programmer</span> that did the actual
              work must review the release notes. Only they are aware of the
              work that was truly done. For this reason they are typically the
              original author of the release notes. If they are the original
              author it is import that they review the final release note too.
              Primarily this is ensure there is a feed back loop. When they see
              how others have edited their release note, this will make them do
              a better job the next time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second reason the programmer needs to review the final release
              note is to check for accuracy. Sometimes a programmer’s initial
              release note may read something like “I have no idea what’s going
              on with this bug. I cleaned some stuff up and hopefully this might
              reduce the error rate”. But by the time marketing gets done the
              release notes turns into “all bugs fixed”. The original author
              needs to make sure that the multiple people’s cumulative edits
              have not corrupted the original message.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="skim-focus">The product manager</span> needs to make
              sure that the release notes tell a story that is consistent with
              the overall vision for the product. They also need to make sure
              the release note aligns with the original user story that
              triggered it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="skim-focus">Marketing</span> can verify the release
              notes carries a message that is consistent with helping new sales
              and upgrades to existing customers. The release note needs to be
              consistent with the overall product vision and the marketing
              message around it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="skim-focus">A technical writer</span> can check the
              release notes for formatting, consistency, and all the little
              important details that may be overlooked by others.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              <span class="skim-focus">Leverage automated tools</span> for
              building release notes,
              <span class="skim-focus">but be wary</span> of automatically
              generated documents. It is invaluable to have access to a
              bug/enhancement tracking system when doing release notes to verify
              the issues that are included in each build. A good system will
              also let you enter a release note for each issue and those will be
              compiled into an automatically generated release notes document.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some systems allow various options for how the release notes
              document is formatted. One of the biggest factors in this is
              whether the document is generated for a single build, provides a
              running list over multiple builds with different sections for each
              build, or is a single flat list of all issues over multiple
              builds. These options can have serious impact on the document
              produced.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the tool automatically merges multiple builds together it is
              nearly impossible to have the tool do a good job on symmetry of
              items. Although some groupings yield good release notes when
              looking at a single build, over multiple builds the groupings may
              need to be revisited. The telling of a consistent story also
              quickly breaks down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine if you had to write an email consisting of about a dozen
              sentences. Image that you were only allowed to write one sentence
              per day. The order that you write the sentences is not the order
              you want the sentences to be arranged in the final email. The
              tooling may not make it easy to review the sentences from previous
              days when writing the new one. Also, other people will be
              contributing their own sentences to be included in the email. This
              is what it is like to enter in release notes as a field in a bug
              tracking system and have and automated release notes report
              attempt to produce a comprehensible document.
            </p>
            <p>
              For these reasons, an automated release note document should only
              be used to automate some of the work in providing the final
              release notes document. The output of the automated tool must be
              reviewed and edited so that all issues are cleaned up.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Hopefully this helps. Happy release noting.</p>
