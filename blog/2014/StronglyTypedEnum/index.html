              Enums are great. They provide a quick, easy to use collection of
              values. They are a great way of indicating the valid, possible
              values to assign to a variable, database field, or API. They offer
              good encapsulation by making sure that all possible values are
              defined in one, easy to find location. They also avoid using
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)"
                >magic numbers</a
              >
              or strings to define possible values.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, enums do have their problems. The first is that under the
              hood, the .NET Framework represents them as an integer primitive.
              Although you may declare a enum to have only three possible values
              {0, 1, and 2}. There is nothing to stop someone from assigning any
              other integer to an enum variable.
            </p>
            <code>
              <pre>
  enum CowboyType {Good, Bad, Ugly}

  public void Foo()
  {
    CowboyType eastwood;
    eastwood = CowboyType.Good;

    //This is totally valid - WTF?!
    eastwood = (CowboyType) 42;
  }
                </pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              The second problem is that the enum is not very extendable. Yes,
              .NET does support extension methods. However, you can’t add
              extension static methods, override the ToString method, or do
              operator overloading.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Strongly Typed Enum design pattern can solve these problems. A
              Strongly Typed Enum is a plain old class that has the same look
              and feel as an enum, but also provides all the benefits of a
              proper class. The basic structure of a Strongly Typed Enum class
              is as follows.
            </p>

            <code>
              <pre>
  class CowboyType
  {
    private CowboyType() { }

    public static readonly CowboyType Good = new CowboyType();
    public static readonly CowboyType Bad = new CowboyType();
    public static readonly CowboyType Ugly = new CowboyType();
  }
                </pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              The class has a
              <span class="skim-focus">private constructor</span>. This ensures
              that nothing outside the class can create an instances of it.
              Nobody can create an instance of a CowboyType class with the value
              42 or other invalid value.
            </p>

            <p>
              The only way to create an instance of the class is through one of
              the three <span class="skim-focus">static read only fields</span>.
              Because they are static, they are instantiated automatically the
              first time the class is referenced. They are declared as read only
              so that their values never change. It doesn’t really matter that
              the underlying objects don’t have any properties. As long as they
              are uniquely instantiated objects. The standard equality operator
              (==) can be used to confirm if two values are equal.
            </p>

            <p>
              These three static fields give the same look and feel as a regular
              enum. They are referenced in the code the same way as the original
              enum was, “CowboyType.Good”. The intellisense offered by Visual
              Studio behaves the same. When a variable is declared of type
              CowboyType, typing the assignment operator (=) invokes the same
              three values in the intellisense drop down list.
            </p>

            <p>
              From this basic starting point you can now extended the class by
              adding any methods you need.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <span class="skim-focus">ToString method</span> can (and
              should) be overridden to report the static field name. The
              build-in enum type does this automatically. You’ll need to
              explicitly add this override in order to maintain the same
              behaviour. The built-in enum type uses reflection to implement its
              ToString method. Obfuscators can thwart the behaviour of the
              enum’s ToString implementation, but this won’t be a problem in the
              overridden method.
            </p>

            <code>
              <pre>
  public override string ToString()
  {
    var map = new Dictionary&lt;CowboyType, string&gt; 
    {
      {Good, "Good"},
      {Bad, "Bad"},
      {Ugly, "Ugly"}
    };
    return map[this];
  }
                </pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              The System.Enum type supports a method to GetValues() or
              GetNames(). A static method can be added to the class to easily
              get at all the member values as an IEnumerable. I implement this
              as an <span class="skim-focus">All method</span> instead of
              calling it GetValues.
            </p>

            <code>
              <pre>
  public static IEnumerable&lt;CowboyType&gt; All()
  {
    yield return Good;
    yield return Bad;
    yield return Ugly;
  }
                </pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              An<span class="skim-focus"> explicit conversion</span> can be
              added to allow casting to or from integers. However, because you
              are implementing this yourself you can choose the behaviour.
              Invalid integers (like 42) can throw an invalid cast exception
              instead of being allowed.
            </p>

            <code>
              <pre>
  public static explicit operator CowboyType(int value)
  {
    var result = All().FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; (int)x == value);
    if (result != null) return result;

    throw new InvalidCastException("The value " + value + " is not a valid CowboyType");
  }
    
  public static explicit operator int(CowboyType value)
  {
    var map = new Dictionary&lt;CowboyType, int&gt;
    {
      {Good, 0},
      {Bad, 1},
      {Ugly, 2}
    };
    return map[value];
  }</pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              Explicit or implicit conversion operators are just two ways to go
              for allowing for conversions between the new enum class and other
              types. “To” methods, like ToString, can also provide this.
              <span class="skim-focus">“From” static methods</span> can be added
              to provide the conversion in the other direction. Providing
              To/From methods usually is easier to trace through than the
              explicit operator and especially the implicit operator. Below is
              the FromString method.
            </p>

            <code>
              <pre>
  public static CowboyType FromString(string value)
  {
    if (value == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("value");
    var result = All().FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.ToString() == value);
    if (result != null) return result;

    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("value", value, "Invalid CowboyType");
  }</pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              I’ll often add ToDbValue and FromDbValue methods as well as the
              To/FromString method. The FromDbValue takes the value as it is
              stored in the database as an input. If I know the column name this
              data type is usually stored in I'll often create an overloaded
              version of FromDbValue that takes a DataRow.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
              You can start adding any other methods you find you need to this
              class. For example it would be easy to add a DefaultHatColor
              method to this class. I often find once I convert a simple enum to
              a strongly typed enum class I start to see new methods to add that
              I never thought of before. Providing a place holder to add logic
              in advance lowers the barrier to actually doing so in the future.
              It makes the the calling code easier to read because often I can
              move those nasty IF statements surrounding my simple enum
              consumption into the strongly typed class. Using simple enums
              instead of proper classes is actually a well defined code smell
              called
              <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrimitiveObsession"
                ><span class="skim-focus">Primitive Obsession</span></a
              >.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
              In the above ToString and CowboyType to int explicit conversion
              methods I use a mapping function to define how each enum member
              maps to the different data type. This has the advantage that if I
              want to add a new To method I can do so by just adding the method
              and its mappings. There is no code outside the new method that
              needs to change.
            </p>

            <p>
              The disadvantage comes when adding a new Enum member (static read
              only field). When doing this all To methods need to be updated to
              map for the new value. If it is more likely that new members are
              added instead of new conversion routines then the pattern can be
              altered to store the string or integer values as private read only
              instance properties. When the static field is initialized it will
              set the values of these private instance properties via the
              private constructor. The To methods just expose these private
              properties, or forego the To methods any make the read only
              instance properties public. Then to add a new member there is only
              a single line that needs to be added, the declaration of static
              field and its call to the private constructor.
              <span class="skim-focus"
                >Which technique to use depends on which type of change is more
                likely</span
              >.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
              So you may be thinking at this point that strongly typed enum
              classes look great, but that’s a lot of code to manually write.
              Well, I have a solution for that. I wrote a small conversion
              program that will take C# or VB source code for a standard enum
              type and convert this into the code for a strongly typed enum
              class. This code is available here:
