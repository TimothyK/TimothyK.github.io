          <main id="post">
            <p>
              Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a set of classes and functions that
              allow a developer to control data over time. It allows for event
              streams to be manipulated as easily as collections can be
              manipulated with LINQ.
            </p>
            <p>
              An event stream can be made up of anything. It could be button
              clicks, key presses, or calls to/from a client or server. One of
              the classic “Hello, world!” examples for Rx is implementing a
              search box [<a href="http://rxwiki.wikidot.com/101samples#toc30"
                >101 Rx Samples</a
              >,
              <a
                href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5438639/rx-autocompletebox"
                >Stack Overflow</a
              >]. This is where the search doesn’t occur until the user has
              stopped typing for a few hundred milliseconds. Searching on every
              keystroke, especially against an external database, would bog down
              the user interface. However with a couple Rx function calls the
              program can aggregate these events, run the search in background
              thread, then return to the UI thread.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              I like to think of Rx as LINQ but extended out to three
              dimensions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first dimension of Rx is <b>Data</b>. LINQ also has this
              dimension. Most LINQ functions you are familiar with are also
              available with Rx event streams. An Rx event stream is defined in
              the library as an <code>IObservable&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is
              analogous to the <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> type. This
              supports a Select method to transform the data to another type and
              a Where method to filter objects on the stream. Rx is also similar
              to LINQ in that it follows a
              <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html"
                >fluent</a
              >, functional programing (FP) style. This FP style allows the code
              to be very expressive and maintainable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second dimension of Rx is <b>Time</b>. Rx has additional
              functions, not found in LINQ, to control and aggregate data on the
              stream over time. Event data can be grouped into time boxes (the
              Buffer or Sample methods), delayed (the Delay method), or monitor
              for missing data (the Timeout method). These are just a few
              examples and I will cover these in this series of blog posts. Also
              note that Rx support a scheduler so that production code that
              works with events over hours can have automated unit tests that
              execute this code in milliseconds.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third dimension of Rx is <b>Threading</b>. By default Rx is
              single threaded. Applying functions like Select or Where will have
              the resulting event stream handled on the same thread that the
              events are generated on. However it is a simple matter of
              injecting the <code>ObserveOn</code> method into the fluent FP
              method chain to offload the work to a different thread or join to
              another thread.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              I found the best way to learn Rx is to try to apply it to a real
              world problems. I’ve found this much more productive than simply
              reading up on all the available methods and hoping to replace my
              existing code with these methods. That was the approach I took
              with LINQ, and for LINQ it was very effective. LINQ can typically
              be used to take non-LINQ code (such as for loops and if
              statements) that are already implemented and replace it with LINQ
              functions and lambdas. Using LINQ functions over conventional
              programming constructs often yielded half the amount of code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve found Rx isn’t applied in the same way. Yes, Rx does reduce
              the lines of code required to solve a problem. However the code
              savings are much, much more than half. Typically I find that the
              problems I am solving with Rx are problems that I wouldn’t even
              attempt to solve if I were limited to conventional programming
              constructs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this series of blog posts the real world problem I’ll be
              looking at is notifying users. There are a number of common
              patterns that I employ when setting up a notification system.
              First and foremost, I want to avoid spamming users with every
              single nugget of information the program is producing. There are
              three patterns I’ll cover:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="../Lossless/">Lossless Notifications</a>, where data
                from each event is aggregated into a single message
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="../UnexpectedErrors/">Unexpected Error Notifications</a
                >, where duplicate errors are thrown out
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="../ConnectionErrors/">Connection Error Notifications</a
                >, where connection are queued and can be cancelled if the
                connection self corrects
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Before I get to these notification patterns, I cover the basics of
              <a href="../CreateStream/"
                >setting up an event stream, subscribing, and a general
                overview</a
              >
              of the test program I’ll be using for the demonstrations. All the
              code is

            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Before we get started, I’ll quickly state some history and
              additional resources. The Rx library is owned and maintained by
              Microsoft. It was originally releases around 2010. It targets the
              4.0 framework, although there is version available that targets
              3.5 if needed.
