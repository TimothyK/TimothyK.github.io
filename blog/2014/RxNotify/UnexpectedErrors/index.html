              A feature that every serious program should have is the ability to
              notify when an unexpected error occurs.  Every unexpected
              error should be reported and investigated.  This is necessary
              in order to build quality software.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this post I’ll cover an Rx notification pattern that will
              report unexpected errors.  As with all notifications, an
              anti-spam rule will be part of the solution.  Unlike the
              <a
                href="../Lossless/"
                >previous example</a
              >, not every single unexpected error needs to be reported. 
              When an unexpected error occurs it is usually the same type of
              error occurring over and over.  The frequency of the error is
              usually unimportant.  Because each reported error is
              investigated, reporting each type of error only once is usually
              sufficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              This notification pattern is the most complicated of the three
              notification patterns I’m covering in this series of posts. 
              I’ll build up to the finally implementation of the pattern in
              three small steps.

                    Sample Method
                  </div>
              <p>
                This first example is quite simple.  It is very similar to
                the previous example of Lossless Notifications.  However, in
                this example we don’t mind losing a few exceptions, as long as we
                catch one exception of each type.  I’m not going to worry
                about the type of the exception until the final example in this
                post.  This first example will simply throw away duplicate
                exceptions on the stream.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the
                <a
                  href="../Lossless/"
                  >last example</a
                >
                we learned of the Buffer method.  That method would take a
                stream of exceptions and report a List of exceptions for each time
                boxed interval.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Sample Rx method preforms a similar time boxing as the Buffer
                method.  However, instead of returning a List of all
                Exception in each time box it simply reports the last one. 
                Any other exceptions in the same time box are discarded.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                    alt="screen-sample"
                    src="screen-sample.png"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                You can see in the example that despite clicking the button
                repeatedly a notification message is only reported once every 2
                seconds.  Only the last exception within this 2 second box is
                reported.
              </p>
              <p>
                The code that implements this is as follows.  It contains the
                standard Do, ObserveOn, and Subscribe method class as all our
                other examples.  The only manipulation done is a simple call
                to the Sample method.
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
    return _exceptionStream
    	.Do(OnRawMessage)
    	.Sample(TimeSpanFactory.FromSeconds(2))
    	.ObserveOn(this)
    	.Subscribe(OnNotificationMessage);</pre

                  <div class="section-header">
                    SampleResponsive Method
                  </div>
  
              <p>
                Although the Sample method does box the exceptions into two second
                intervals, there is a very subtle behaviour in how it does this
                that I don’t like.  Exactly when each time box starts and
                stops is somewhat random.  Note from the example above that
                Exception 1 was not notified on until 1.6 second after it first
                fired.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                With a trivial anti-spam example with a time interval of 2 seconds
                this 1.6 second delay might not sound like much of a
                problem.  However in the real world this interval may be
                increased to 15 minutes or more.  This can be a real
                problem.  Unexpected errors can often precede the program
                becoming unstable and crashing.  Crashed programs report no
                notifications.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                I would like to slightly change the behaviour of the Sample method
                so that when an exception occurs with no preceding exceptions in
                the previous 2 seconds that exception is notified on
                immediately.  Subsequent exceptions in the next 2 second
                interval can be filtered out and the behaviour can return the same
                as the original Sample method.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The trouble is that the Microsoft Rx library has no such function
                with the behaviour I would like.  However, with a little
                Googling I found a SampleResponsive method [<a
                  href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3211134/how-to-throttle-event-stream-using-rx"                
                  >Stack Overflow</a
                >,
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/TimothyK/RxExamples/blob/master/RxExamples/RxExtensions.cs"
                  >GitHub</a
                >] that does exactly what I want.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                I’m not going to trace through the code of the SampleResponsive
                method.  Its implementation details are not important to this
                example.  My real purpose of this example is to show how
                powerful the Rx community is.  There are a limited number of
                functions in Microsoft’s Rx library.  They are good
                functions.  Sometimes they do exactly what you want and at
                the very least they are the good building blocks.  If you
                think Rx can solve your problem but you just aren’t sure how,
                search or ask around.  You can probably find it.

                  </div>
  
              <p>
                As promised in this final example of this post I will now take on
                the issue of ensuring each unique type is notified on.  First
                let’s illustrate the current problem we have with the Sample
                Responsive example.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                <img
                    alt="screenshot - Group By"
                    src="screen-GroupBy.png"
                />
              </p>
  
              <p>
                In this example Null Reference exceptions are the first an last
                errors that occur, in quick succession.  Between these two
                Null Reference exceptions two other Divide By Zero exceptions
                occur.  However our code doesn’t worry about the type of the
                exception.  Therefore those Divide By Zero exceptions are
                filtered out by the Sample Responsive method and never reported
                on.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                To solve this we use the Rx GroupBy method.  We need to
                intelligently group on the type of the exceptions.  It
                wouldn’t be a good idea to group on the exception message, because
                that can often contain context information that changes with each
                pass through the code.  The type won’t change for multiple
                occurrences of the same error.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Grouping on the type of exception may not be sufficient.  It
                is possible that the same type of exception is being reported from
                two different areas of the application.  Therefore as well as
                the type of the exception, we should also group on the stack
                trace.  This comparison should be done recursively on the
                inner exceptions.  I’ve written a ExceptionEqualityComparer
                that implements this strategy of comparing exceptions. 
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/TimothyK/RxExamples/blob/master/RxExamples/NotificationPatterns/ExceptionEqualityComparer.cs"
                  >The source code is here.</a
                >
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The subscription code I use for Unexpected Error Notifications is
                as follows:
              </p>
  
              <code>
                <pre>
    var comparer = new ExceptionEqualityComparer();
    return _exceptionStream
    	.Do(OnRawMessage)
    	.GroupBy(ex =&gt; ex, comparer)
    	.Subscribe(streamOfGivenType =&gt;
    		streamOfGivenType
    			.SampleResponsive(TimeSpanFactory.FromSeconds(2))
    			.ObserveOn(this)
    			.Subscribe(OnNotificationMessage));</pre
                >
              </code>
  
              <p>
                The GroupBy method takes in an event stream (<code>IObservable</code>) and
                returns an <code>IObservable&lt;IGroupedObservable&gt;</code>.  They way I
                like to think of this return type is as a collection or array of
                IObservable objects.  The Subscribe method following the
                GroupBy essentially is working on each element in this array and
                setting up a separate subscription to each element.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The inner subscription is the same as our previous example using
                the <code>SampleResponsive</code> method.  It is nested so an independent
                copy of this subscription is running for each unique type of
                exception.  This yields the final behaviour that I want in my
                Unexpected Error notification pattern.
              </p>
  
              <p>
