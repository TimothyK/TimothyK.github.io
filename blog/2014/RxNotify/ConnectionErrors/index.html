                The last Notification Pattern I’ll cover in this series of posts
                is how to handle connection error notifications. Connection
                errors are different than other kinds of errors. They aren’t
                really bugs; they’re just shit that happens. Your program can’t
                really control it. The best your program can do is just to
                handle the error gracefully.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can’t speak to much about “handling gracefully” as depends on
                the context of your program. If it is a front end user interface
                perhaps a Retry/Cancel message box will do the trick. If it’s a
                background service then its probably best just to go to sleep
                and try again a few minutes later.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the finicky thing about connections errors is they
                can be intermittent. They can correct themselves over a short
                period of time. If administrators routinely takes down a service
                temporarily to do regular maintenance this intermittent
                connection error may be just part of normal operation.
              </p>
              <p>
                This post is about how to handle the notification of an
                intermittent error. Sure, we could apply the same notification
                pattern we used for unexpected errors. But if the system comes
                back online, by the time someone responds to the notification
                they will only find their self on a wild goose chase. Do this
                too often and
                <a

                  >you are training people to ignore</a
                >
                your notifications, and that is not what you want.

              <div class="section-header">The Behaviour</div>
              <p>
                The behaviour we want out of this pattern is when a connection
                error occurs we should queue up a notification to be delivered
                at some point in the near future. When it comes time to actually
                deliver the notification we check if the connection has been
                restored. If the connection has been restored we cancel the
                notification.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                  alt="screenshot - State Aware"
                  src="screen-stateAware.png"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/TimothyK/RxExamples"
                  >The example program</a
                >
                has two buttons: one to indicate a connection error occurred,
                and another to that indicates the connection is good.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the first connection error occurs we get a notification of
                it 3 seconds later. We have a burst of 9 errors and due the
                anti-spam rule we implemented in the
                <a href="../UnexpectedErrors/">previous example</a>
                only the first and ninth errors are reported.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then we get another burst of connection errors (#10 through 15).
                However in this example shortly after error #15 we click the
                Success button and no notifications are sent. This pattern is
                repeated again with errors 16 through 18.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally we repeat the first example of raising error #19 without
                a transition back to a good connection state. Error #19 is
                notified on three seconds later.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">The Code</div>
              <p>
                In order to implement this pattern we are going to have to
                handle state. This Connections State will be stored in a simple
                Boolean property. For demonstration purposes, I’ve added a bit
                of logging when the state changes.
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
    private bool _isConnected;
    private bool IsConnected
    {	
      get { return _isConnected; }
      set
      {
        if (_isConnected == value) return;
  
        _isConnected = value;
        OnRawMessage("Connection State transitioning to " 
          + (value ? "good" : "disconnected"));
      }
    }
    </pre
                >
              </code>

              <p>
                The Connection Error button pushes an error onto an IObservable
                exception event stream, just like in our previous examples. The
                Success button doesn’t do anything with the stream; it just sets
                IsConnected to true.
              </p>

              <p>Here is the subscription code:</p>

              <code>
                <pre>
    return _exceptionStream
      .Do(OnRawMessage)
      .Do(ex =&gt; IsConnected = false)
      .Delay(TimeSpanFactory.FromSeconds(3))
      .SampleResponsive(TimeSpanFactory.FromSeconds(2))
      .Where(ex =&gt; !IsConnected)
      .ObserveOn(this)
      .Subscribe(OnNotificationMessage);
      </pre
                >
              </code>

              <p>
                The subscription function chain has the same elements from the
                previous examples. It starts by writing the raw message to the
                TextBox on the left. It ends by returning to (ObserveOn) the UI
                thread and writing the notification message to the TextBox on
                the right.
              </p>

              <p>
                Disregarding this standard template, the first thing we do is
                call the Do method and transition the current state to
                disconnected.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then we need to “queue” the notifications to be delivered later.
                We introduce this delay with the Rx Delay method (obviously).
              </p>

              <p>
                The Delay method doesn’t do anything to aggregate a burst of
                error messages. Therefore we steal from our previous example the
                SampleResponsive method to discard some of the exceptions. This
                is my go-to anti-spam function.
              </p>

              <p>
                The last thing we do in the function chain (template cruft
                aside) is to simply use the Where method to check if the
                connection state is still disconnected. This Where function will
                be executed 3 to 5 seconds after the original call to the Do
                method. That’s how long we allow for the flaky connection to
                restore itself. If the connection has restored the Where
                function removes the exception from the stream, thereby
                cancelling the notification.
              </p>

                This ends my five part series on Notification Patterns. I find
                that most notifications I need to send in the real world will be
                a variation on these three Notification Patterns. Again, they
                are:
                <a href="../Lossless/">Lossless Notifications</a>
                (Buffer),
                <a href="../UnexpectedErrors/">Unexpected Errors</a>
                (SampleResponsive and GroupBy), and Connection Errors (Delay and
                state). Also check out the
                <a href="../Intro/">Introduction to Rx</a>
                (additional resource links) and
                <a href="../CreateStream/">Creating a Stream</a>
                (Subject). With these tips, hopefully implementing a good email
                delivery system won’t make you “go postal”.
