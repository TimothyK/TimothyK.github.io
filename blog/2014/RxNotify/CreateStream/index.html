          <main id="post">
            <p>
              In this and the next few blog posts I’m going to be going over
              some examples of how to use Rx to help distribute notifications.
              I’ve posted
              <a href="https://github.com/TimothyK/RxExamples"
                >all the source code on GitHub</a
              >. Before we get to the actual examples of managing notifications,
              this post will cover the preamble of the basic framework of the
              example program and how to create a stream of data to work with.
              This first example doesn’t do anything fancy with the data (yet),
              it is just feeding data into an IObservable to work with later.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong><u>The Demo Application</u></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve chosen to have the demo program be a simple windows desktop
              application. I could have done this with unit tests, but I think
              the demonstration works better with a visual GUI. It is
              interactive so you can control when the buttons are clicked.
            </p>
            <p>
              The form has a button to raise events. These examples are for
              Notification Patterns, therefore the data on the event stream will
              Exception objects. Each exception will include an ID number so
              that you can easily trace through the order of events.
            </p>
            <p>
              The form has two scrolling TextBox controls. The one of the left
              reports the raw stream; every time the button is clicked a log
              message is added to the left TextBox. The right TextBox reports
              the aggregated or filtered notifications. Due to the anti-spam Rx
              filters we will be applying, the right TextBox should only display
              a subset or aggregate of the events displayed on the right.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img alt="Screenshot" src="screen-unaltered.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              I reuse the same form for all 6 examples in the blog post series.
              Each example is encapsulated in a user control, which gets loaded
              on the main form when you choose an example from the ComboBox at
              the top. To maximize code reuse and provide a common interface,
              each example control inherits from a common base class
              (NotificationPattern), which derives from UserControl. This base
              class supports: a PatternName (which is displayed in the
              ComboBox), events to pipe a message to the left (raw) TextBox or
              the right (notification) TextBox, ensures the Subscribe method
              gets called when the control is loaded, a Dispose method to
              unsubscribe at shutdown, and a sequence number to feed into the
              Exception objects on the Event stream.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each user control example has its own buttons, which will feed
              data onto the event stream. Some examples have more that one
              button.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some examples also include a delay or time boxing. Most examples
              limit spam so that Notifications are only reported at most once
              every 2 seconds. Two seconds isn’t exactly a good anti-spam limit,
              but for this for the purpose of this demo it works quite well.
              However if you want a more realistic example, the “Delay x10”
              CheckBox increases these time spans in order to slow down the
              demonstration.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong><u>Creating a Stream</u></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              So the first example pushes a NumberedException object onto the
              event stream. NumberedException is a simple custom Exception,
              which adds an ID number to the Exception class. Here is the code
              behind the “Raise Error” button.
            </p>
            <code>
              <pre>
  private void btnRaise_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
  {
  	try
  	{
		throw new NumberedException(NextEventID())
  	}
  	catch (NumberedException ex)
  	{
  		_exceptionStream.OnNext(ex)
  	} 
  }</pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              The NextEventID method is from the base class and just returns a
              sequential number for the Exceptions.
            </p>

            <p>
              The exception object is pushed onto the event stream using the
              OnNext method. The _exceptionStream variable represents the event
              stream. But what’s that, you ask?
            </p>

            <code>
              <pre>
  private Subject&lt;NumberedException&gt; _exceptionStream;</pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              The exception stream is of type Subject. This is a type defined in
              the Rx libraries. Subject implements the IObservable interface.
              This is analogous to how the List class implements the IEnumerable
              interface. The Subject.OnNext method is analogous to the List.Add
              method. OnNext is specific to the Subject and not defined for
              IObservable. This is just like IEnumerable does not have an Add
              method, although the List does.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Subject class is just one way to create an IObservable. There
              are other ways to do this. The Observable class has a variety of
              static methods to create simple test streams. There is also the
              FromEventPattern sequence to create an IObservable from a standard
              event. The Task class has an ToObservable method. To keep things
              simple, in these blog posts I will only be using the Subject class
              to create event streams.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong><u>Subscribing to the Stream</u></strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Now that we have a stream of events, we can subscribe to this
              stream in order to route these events to the TextBox controls.
              Here is the Subscribe method of the example user control:
            </p>

            <code>
              <pre>
  protected override IDisposable Subscribe()
  {
  	_exceptionStream = new Subject&lt;NumberedException&gt;();
  
  	return _exceptionStream
  		.Do((NumberedException ex) =&gt; OnRawMessage(ex.Message))
      .Subscribe((NumberedException ex) =&gt; OnNotificationMessage(ex.Message));
  }
  </pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              The example user control’s Subscribe method is called by the main
              form when the example user control is loaded. This initialization
              function creates the Subject object. It then calls the IObservable
              Do and Subscribe methods.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Do method is a way to inject side effects into the stream of
              events. You can think of the Do method like the Select LINQ method
              that always returns the same thing, or the Where method that
              always returns true. In addition to just passing along events on
              the stream, it also can take action on those events.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this example, and all examples in these blog posts, the Do
              method is the first method called and it will raise the RawMessage
              event, which writes the message to the left (raw) TextBox on the
              main form. This ensures that every button click is shown in the
              user interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              Similar to the fluent API of LINQ methods, the Do method takes an
              IObservable and returns an IObservable. This provides the same
              fluent chaining style of method calls that LINQ has with its
              various IEnumerable methods.
            </p>

            <p>
              The last method called in the IObservable.Subscribe method. This
              method takes a lambda expression that defines the final action to
              be taken on the event stream. In all examples in these blog posts
              the lambda passed to the subscribe method will route the Exception
              object to the Notification TextBox on the right of the main form.
              In a real world application this lambda would send out a
              notification email or SMS text message.
            </p>

            <p>
              IObservable.Subscribe is a terminus method, in the same way that
              ToArray or ToList are terminus methods in LINQ. The Do method,
              like Select and Where, has delayed execution and would not be
              called until a terminus method is called.
            </p>

            <p>
              Subscribe does not return an IObservable, instead it returns an
              IDisposable. There isn’t an explicit Unsubscribe method. To
              unsubscribe simply call Dispose on the value returned from the
              Subscribe method.
            </p>

            <p>
              So in summary, the IObservable.Subscribe method wires up the given
              lambda expression to the data passed to the Subject.OnNext method.
              I’m not going to be covering this in these posts, but just for
              completeness I want to note that the Subject class also has an
              OnError and OnCompleted methods. Similar to how a classic I/O
              stream has Standard Output and Standard Error streams, the
              IObservable and Subject classes also have these concepts. The
              Subscribe method can take a second lambda to process this
              secondary error stream. OnCompleted gets called when no other
              events will be sent down the stream. Its kind of like an end of
              file indicator. This event can also be handled from the Subscribe
              method.
            </p>

            <p>
              <u><strong>Manipulating the Stream</strong></u>
            </p>

            <p>
              I know I said I wasn’t going to do this, but I’ll show a few
              examples of how to manipulate the stream. This unaltered stream
              example is a good starting point to start messing around with Rx
              functions and see what they do.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first example is to add a Where function, which is also in
              LINQ, to filter the event stream to only show the Exceptions with
              an odd ID number. I’ve also removed some of the redundant typing
              off the lambda expressions. The OnRawMessage and
              OnNotificationMessage functions support an overloaded version that
              takes an Exception instead of a string, so in fact the lambdas are
              completely unnecessary.
            </p>

            <code>
              <pre>
  return _exceptionStream
  	.Do(OnRawMessage)
  	.Where(ex =&gt; ex.ID % 2 == 1)
  	.Subscribe(OnNotificationMessage);</pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              In a final example I will use the Rx Delay method to simply delay
              the notifications by a couple seconds. As promised, Rx can be used
              to manipulate time.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Delay method will implicitly shunt the stream to another
              thread. This is a side effect the Delay method must introduce in
              order to allow it to control time.
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to successfully write the final message to the
              Notification TextBox, the thread must re-join the UI thread. This
              can be easily done by calling the ObserveOn method, passing in the
              user control that supports the Invoke method. Rx can control
              threads just as easily as time or data.
            </p>

            <code>
              <pre>
  return _exceptionStream
  	.Do(OnRawMessage)
  	.Where(ex =&gt; ex.ID % 2 == 1)
  	.Delay(TimeSpanFactory.FromSeconds(2))
  	.ObserveOn(this)
  	.Subscribe(OnNotificationMessage);</pre
              >
            </code>

            <p>
              These are two quick examples to show how to manipulate the stream
              before it is subscribed to. In the
              <a href="../Lossless/">next post</a>
              I’ll show a real world notification pattern of buffering
              exceptions to reduce spam whilst still capturing all data.
