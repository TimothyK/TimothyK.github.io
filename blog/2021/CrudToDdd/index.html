            <p>One of the most common axioms of software design is that there should be separation of the user
              interface, business logic, and database. There are principles like Dependency Injection, design patterns
              like MVC, and a variety of frameworks that claim to encourage or enforce this separation. All these focus
              on the technical details of how to separate these concerns, but they rarely discuss why this is important.
            </p>
            <p>There is a fundamental mind shift that occurs when properly extracting business logic that people are
              otherwise unaware of or misunderstand. This mind shift is as profound as the difference between assembly
              and object-orientated code. The impact is not just for designers and programmers, but for business
              analysts and customers too.</p>
            <p>Also note, that I’m not against CRUD designs. They have their place, and in fact most software projects
              out there use this successfully. Also, I’m not implying that CRUD is easier than DDD, or vice versa. These
              are two valid approaches to systems development. There isn’t one best approach for all situations.</p>
            <p>Each can be used successfully, independently. Even within one system part of it may be a CRUD application
              and other parts may follow a DDD approach. Sometimes there is a need to transition from CRUD to DDD, or
              vice versa. My point is that software teams need to be aware that these two approaches exist, have respect
              for each of them, and be able to transition between the two when necessary.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div class="section-header">CRUD</div>
            <p>Before I talk about DDD or transitioning to it, let me first describe a CRUD-style design.</p>
            <p>CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four operations users routinely perform
              on a database table. This is also known as a data-centric design.</p>
            <p>To start designing a CRUD system, the business analyst must identify the entities is the customer’s
              domain. There will be a page in the application for each entity and a database table to back it. There
              will be list (probably searchable) to Read the rows in the database, there will be a Create or Add button
              allow them to create a new row. There will be an Edit page to view all the properties of the row. And
              finally, there will be a Delete or Deactivate button. The Edit page is the most complicated to design. The
              business analyst must work with the customer to define all the properties of that entity.</p>
            <p>Here are some things to notice when designing a CRUD system:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is typically the customer that is defining the database design and user interface. They decide what
                the tables are in the database and the columns (properties).</li>
              <li>There is a very tight coupling of User Interface and the Database. It doesn’t really matter if the
                customer describes their desired system in terms of the user interface or the database structure,
                because there is a simple one-to-one mapping between the two.</li>
              <li>There is little in the system for business logic. There maybe a few validation rules here and there,
                but in general the developers working on the project are not aware of how the data is used to help the
                customer’s business. The users are experts in the domain, and they will know what to enter in all the
                fields or interpret the values entered by others.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div class="section-header">Domain Driven Design</div>
            <p>Domain Driven Design takes a different approach than CRUD. With DDD the focus is on the business goals
              and rules, not on the data. DDD focuses on actions and events that are taken to meet those business goals.
            </p>
            <p>To illustrate this, let’s take a hypothetical example of a shipping company. Here is a 
              <span class="skim-focus">business</span> workflow used to fill new orders.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>First, we will need select from a <span class="skim-focus">list of new orders</span> that haven’t been filled.</li>
              <li>Then we <span class="skim-focus">print a shipping label</span> the user can stick to a new empty box. 
                We also need to provide them with <span class="skim-focus">the order details</span>
                so that they know what to put in the box.</li>
              <li>Finally, we <span class="skim-focus">verify</span> the box if full by weighing it and comparing the weight with a know weights of the
                products that should have been loaded. The order is considered Shipped once this verification is done.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <span class="skim-focus">user interface</span> that would be developed to support this design flow from the business process. 
              There are 3 screens/pages in this part of the system, each tailored to the task at hand.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The new orders list with a select button.</li>
              <li>The order details either on a tablet or printed.</li>
              <li>The verification screen that captures a weight.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each screen is small. There is limited scope to each. 
              This allows for a lot of flexibility in the design and the technologies used.  
              The orders list can be on a PC.  
              Perhaps a UI for this task isn't needed at all and the order can be automatically selected.
              The order details may be on a tablet or a printed page. 
              The verification might be done on a PC desktop application or an IoT solutions with a bar code reader and scale interface. 
              Each task in the system has its own user interface, which is easy to change and decoupled from other tasks.</p>
            <p>The <span class="skim-focus">data</span> needed to support these tasks is separated as well.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There must be a database (or service) with new orders. An order must be able to be selected and
                removed from this list.</li>
              <li>The user’s tablet doesn’t need much of a database. It only needs to show one record at a time. It can
                throw the data away once the task is complete.</li>
              <li>The verification captures a weight, but it doesn’t necessarily need to store it. Once the verification
                is complete an event can be broadcast to the system that the order has been shipped.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The event that an order has been shipped might be subscribed to by various processes. One process might
              record in a database that the order has been shipped, which may or may not be the same database where new
              orders are stored. Another process might inform the customer that their package is on the way. Another
              process might verify that the shipment has been filled in a timely manner and verify that the order
              doesn’t need to be resubmitted to the new orders list.</p>
            <p>There are lots of possibilities on what the system could do when a package is verified as shipped. But
              those actions have no impact on the verification process or the person doing that task.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div class="section-header">Comparison</div>
            <p>Let’s think about how this same business from the DDD example would have been approached as a CRUD
              application. In the CRUD application there would be an Orders list, which could be filtered to New Orders.
              This would open to an Order edit page. The edit page shows the details. There would be a Status drop down
              list to indicate if the order is New, Being Filled, or Shipped. Users would tell the system of the two
              required state transitions by selecting the new state and clicking the Save button. There would be a
              weight field that would be required to be filled if the Status is Shipped. The save would fail if the
              incorrect weight were entered.</p>
            <p>The CRUD system is much easier to describe what technical requirements are. It can be done in a single
              paragraph. We don’t need to describe the user interface and the database because one exactly matches the
              other. There is a single business rule, which is easy to implement.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the CRUD design may be able to be used by not just the people filling the orders, but also
              by people entering new orders and those looking for shipped orders. However, this can be a double-edged
              sword. Although the code is reused, the layout of the screen may not be suited to all users. There also
              may be scalability problems. This can also cause maintenance problems; a user needing a new field for
              order creation will impact the same screen used by people filling orders.</p>
            <p>The DDD application may seem more complicated to describe. There are a lot more pieces. There are
              separate options for user interface and databases, and these can change for each task. Although this might
              seem more complicated on the surface, it yields a more flexible system. The components are smaller, easier
              to change, more scalable, and easier to tailor for each user.</p>
            <p>DDD also can be more difficult to describe because the business process and goals need to be very well
              defined. This information needs to be available to developers, project managers, and users. Although
              difficult, this does allow for the software development team to see the business goals. This can make
              business opportunities that could be solved through software more visible and possible.</p>
            <p>It can be more difficult to learn DDD because of the lack of examples. 
              An experienced CRUD application developer has a <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?GoldenHammer">golden hammer</a> 
              that clobbers off most of the work on a new project, before you even talk to the customer. 
              With a DDD approach there is no “one solution fits all”. 
              It relies more heavily on developers attacking one problem at a time, using a variety of tools at their disposal, 
              and applying sound software design principles to move the project forward.</p>
            <p>DDD is not for everyone. Some customers feel burdened having to explain their business to developers.
              Some developers aren’t interested in the customer’s business and would prefer to focus on the technical
              details.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div class="section-header">Transition Pitfalls</div>
            <p>Most developer begin their careers doing CRUD applications. These types of applications are extremely
              popular. Once a developer has mastered this skill, they are often pressured to separate the UI, Database,
              and Business logic. There may be problems maintaining a large CRUD system, that some feel is easily solved
              by developers separating out these layers.</p>
            <p>A sole developer trying to separate a CRUD monolith into different layers without an understanding DDD
              can be a rather fruitless endeavour. The analysis of what the business needs usually results in a
              “business” layer with the functions: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It typically results in an overly
              complicated onion/lasagna code base, with fundamentally the same design, and that is not easier to
              maintain.</p>
            <p>In this crude attempt, the user interface and database designs don’t change, only an attempt is made to
              create a business layer in between them. However, the UI and database fit together so well before that
              introducing a layer in between them feels burdensome. Customers still control the UI and database design.
              When they need a change they will request a change to both these layers, which inevitably requires a
              change to the new business layer too. The business layer doesn’t add much value. It just feels like
              latency in the development process that slows the team down.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div class="section-header">Successful Transitions</div>
            <p>To successfully transition from CRUD to DDD systems requires team buy-in. Everyone on the team needs to
              understand how the approach taken with DDD is fundamentally different that CRUD. The biggest difference in
              these approaches is not the technologies used, nor the structure of the code, but it is how problems get
              solved.</p>
            <p>A successful DDD team needs buy-in from the customers too. The software team, including project managers
              and business analysts, needs to work with the customer on their business goals. The goals of the business
              will be something like cost-effective shipping of packages. The goal of the business is never merely to
              feed a database.</p>
