          <main id="post">
            <p>
              So I was listening to a recent
              <a href="http://www.westerndevs.com/">Western Developer’s</a>
              podcast
              <a href="http://www.westerndevs.com/podcasts/podcast-ethics/"
                >on Ethics</a
              >. At one point in the conversation [39:30] there was a call for
              establishing a industry standard professional body for software
              developers. This would be much like the Bar Association for
              lawyers or the Medical Board for doctors. It would be responsible
              for establishing a set of guidelines or rules for software
              development professionals to follow. It would grant membership to
              those properly trained and punish those that act unprofessionally.
              This is also a common theme from
              <a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1094">Uncle Bob</a>
              [23:00].
            </p>
            <p>
              Neither of these podcasts stated what that code of ethics should
              be or how we would go about forming this body. It would certainly
              be difficult to do. In my opinion this will never happen. I hold
              this opinion not because I think it is too difficult, but because
              I think we shouldn’t. I do believe we need to act professionally
              and we need to apply ethics to our jobs. However, I don’t think we
              could successfully build a governance body and have this widely
              accepted by our clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are a service industry. We generally don’t serve individuals,
              like doctors serve patients. We serve industries. We write
              software for the health care, legal, engineering, or accounting
              industries. We usually specialize in serving a single industry. In
              my opinion software companies that specialize in a single industry
              are more successful at meeting their clients needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              When specializing in servicing an industry you must become part of
              that industry. You must learn to talk like you clients. You must
              adopt their culture and behaviours.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              For example let’s look at serving the health care industry.
              Doctors are bound by their medical board to save lives. That is
              their code of ethics. Although hospital administrators are not
              doctors and not ruled by the same medical board, due to their
              service to the industry they do follow many of the same core
              ethics. Hospital administrators work within fixed budgets to save
              as many lives as possible. Their actions save lives, the same as
              doctors save lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              A hospital administrator could print flyers reminding people to
              wash their hands and this can save lives. The costs of this
              printing project could save more lives per dollar than keeping a
              surgical staff on call. So when an administrator needs to make a
              decision to print flyers or fund a surgical team they can apply
              their ethics to help them make this decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now for a software example, let’s say a hospital administrator
              wants you to build a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front"
                >big design up front</a
              >, 3 year waterfall project. You know because of your training
              and/or experience as a software development professional that this
              approach is likely to fail. It is a waste of money. A professional
              software developer would argue with the administrator that it is
              better to break the project down into smaller Agile projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              When arguing with the hospital administrator as to the whether or
              not the waterfall project should be done, this argument must be
              framed in the context of the health care industry. The software
              developer should refuse to do the waterfall project. Not because
              their software professional organization states that waterfall is
              wrong. The reason should be because the waterfall project will not
              save as many lives compared to spending that same hospital budget
              on other potential projects.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              We cannot superimpose ethics of the software development
              profession (or any other industry) on our client’s industry. If we
              cannot restate our ethics in the terminology of our client’s
              industry we will not be successful.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the accounting industry there is a very strict audit trail.
              Every penny received from the sale of an item can be traced
              through to how that is redistributed to employee salaries,
              building maintenance costs, raw materials, vendors, taxes, and
              shareholders. An accountant would consider it unprofessional if
              they were not able to produce this audit trail.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, other industries do not have as strict an audit trail.
              The agriculture and food industry generally cannot produce an
              audit trail to trace a loaf of bread back to the farmer’s field
              where the wheat was grown on. An accountant may look at that and
              claim it is unprofessional. The farmer and baker would reject
              their arguments. The accountant would not be able to argue the
              point purely on the professionalism of an audit trail. However,
              they might be more successful if they could reframe their argument
              as a food safety issue. Food safety is part of the ethics the
              farmer and baker are bound to. The agriculture industry does batch
              together food from multiple farms and verify the quality and
              safety of the batch, but they might never be able to trace grains
              of wheat as accurately as accountants track pennies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, to the agricultural professional one should not waste
              food or other resources. Tracking individual grains of wheat would
              certainly be seen by farmers and bakers as wasteful and therefore
              unprofessional. The same qualities that may make someone a
              professional in one industry could seem unprofessional if
              unconditionally applied in other industries.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
              Although we can and should train software developers to be
              professional and ethical, we cannot directly superimpose those
              standards on the industries we serve. Professional software
              developers must hold two degrees: one in software development and
              another in the domain and ethics of the industry they serve. If we
              cannot adapt our ethics to the terms of our clients (on a client
              by client basis) we risk being branded as unprofessional. This
              could, or perhaps has, lead to the software profession as a whole
              being labeled as immature.
