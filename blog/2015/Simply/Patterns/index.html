            <p>
              In my
              <a href="../Working/">last post</a>
              I stated that the only guideline for writing good software is to
              make it simple. There are a number of very specific code analyses
              that can be applied during a code review that help guide towards
              that goal (see
              <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC"
                >Clean Code</a
              >). In addition to those code analyses there are also a whole
              family of rules and anti-patterns focused solely on Simplicity.
              These are worth learning so that they can be recognized and
              corrected when they begin to bleed into your work.

              <div class="section-header">KISS</div>
              <p>
                The grand-daddy of all these rules is <em>KISS</em>. This is an
                acronym for “Keep it simple, stupid”. This principle states that
                simple systems work better than complicated ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                The term comes from the US Navy in the 1960s. The term “stupid”
                doesn’t refer to the engineers designing the solution; it refers
                to those people that will be tasked to maintain the system
                later. You want to keep a system so simple that even stupid
                people can understand it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Navy personnel maintaining the systems <u>must</u> be able
                to figure out what's wrong and fix it quickly. They don't have
                time to decipher and discuss with their supervisor how the
                pieces needs to go back together; it should be obviously to any
                simpleton. They need to fix it quickly, usually while being shot
                at, and the lives of everyone they work with depends on it.

              <div class="section-header">Clever Code</div>
              <p>
                The term “clever” is usually used sarcastically to describe
                code. “Clever” usually describes very terse code that solves the
                problem in a non-obvious way.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Clever” is used as the antonym of “stupid” from the “keep it
                simple stupid” rule. Only clever developers will be able to
                maintain the code, not average or stupid developers.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is better to write code that is embarrassingly obvious as to
                what it is doing (Declares Intent) as opposed to clever.

              <div class="section-header">Golden Hammer</div>
              <p>
                “Golden Hammer” is an anti-pattern. It is usually expressed with
                the phrase, “if the only tool you have is a hammer then every
                problem starts to look like a nail”. This warning is important
                to have on this list because it is very important to not confuse
                the terms “simple” and “familiar”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes KISS can be used to impede learning and
                experimentation. The argument is that that the “simplest”
                solution is just to do the same thing we did last time. Although
                that is familiar, it is not necessarily the simplest solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example someone that this very familiar with assembly
                programming may believe that writing a program in assembly is
                easier that writing the same program in a object orientated
                language (with the learning that implies).
              </p>
              <p>
                Sticking with the familiar can put you in a rut. If not
                corrected this can lead to obsolescence.

                  >Yak Shaving</a
                >
              </div>
              <p>
                Although the Golden Hammer anti-pattern teaches us that learning
                and experimenting on a project is a good thing, too much of this
                can be bad. Beware of creating artificial and chaining
                dependencies on your project.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, I’m already to release my new software build.
                However, before I release I want to test it on that new
                operating system. In order to do that I’m going to have to setup
                a virtualization server. But I don’t know how to do that. No
                problem, there is a conference on that in Elbonia next week.
                However, they use yak hair as currency there and I have none.
                So, I’m at the zoo shaving this yak, and why? Because somehow in
                my mind I’ve built up an artificial dependency that shaving this
                yak is a requirement before I can release my software.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before adding dependencies (and especially dependencies of
                dependencies) on your project, make sure those dependencies are
                inline with the overall vision for your project, product, or
                career. If those dependencies add significantly more work than
                the golden hammer, consider reducing their scope. You don’t want
                to completely eliminate all opportunities for learning, but you
                don’t need to get a doctorate degree either. Just take an
                opportunity to improve a little on every project.

              <p>
                Another acronym rule is YAGNI, “you aren’t gonna need it”. The
                simplest way to implement something is to not implement it at
                all. The faster you realize this is the correct course of action
                the more time you’ll save. And, it’s always 100% bug free.

              <div class="section-header">Premature Optimization</div>
              <p>
                Premature Optimization is an anti-pattern derived from applying
                the YAGNI rule to performance of the system. Systems need to be
                able to perform at speeds that are tolerable to users, no more.
                Beta or proof of concept systems may not even need that.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is possible to spend weeks of development to squeeze just a
                few milliseconds of savings out of a program. Make sure this is
                <a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/">worth it</a>.

                Worse Is Better (New Jersey Style)
              </div>
              <p>
                <a href="http://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html"
                  >Worse is Better</a
                >
                (aka the New Jersey Style) is a philosophy proposed by Richard
                Gabriel that states that is better to have a simple system over
                a correct one. It is presented as an alternative to doing “The
                Right Thing” (aka the MIT approach).
              </p>
              <p>
                Really what this philosophy is supporting is an iterative
                approach to software development. It is better to get into
                production a simple system that will handle 99.9999% of customer
                transactions rather than spending much more time building a
                complicated system that could handle every transaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, supporting complicated customer scenarios might
                make the system harder to use for simple transactions. Adding
                100% correctness in the system could hurt overall usability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trying to design and implement a perfect system can be a futile,
                never ending, never delivered endeavour. In the real world there
                is no such thing as perfect. Simple can be a better, more
                realistic target.

              <div class="section-header">Big Design Up Front</div>
              <p>
                The “Worse Is Better” philosophy applies to both design and
                implementation of a system. If this is limited to just design,
                “the right thing” forms the anti-pattern “Big Design Up Front”.
                In this scenario people spend a long time attempting to design
                every aspect of a system before any implementation or delivery
                is done. Instead of multiple, incremental releases all the
                functionality is attempted to be delivered in a single release.
                The large scope of the one and only development cycle makes the
                development process complicated.

                Bike Shedding (Parkinson’s Law of Triviality)
              </div>
              <p>
                Parkinson’s Law of Triviality notes that more people are willing
                to spend more time arguing over small, trivial systems than
                large, complex ones. The example given why this is the case is a
                comparison of building a nuclear reactor as opposed to a bike
                shed. The design concepts needed for building a nuclear reactor
                are complicated, therefore there are fewer people able to
                constructively criticize this. However, the design of a bike
                shed is easy to understand, therefore it invites more criticism.
              </p>
              <p>
                The effect that this has is that even small components of a
                system, which should be simple, can be turned into complicated
                ones due to endless meetings and design reviews.
              </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>
              Writing software can be complicated. It almost always takes some
              refactoring and management to turn complicated systems into simple
              ones. Hopefully this partial list of Simplicity principles and
              anti-patterns can serve as a reference guide for a daily reminder
              to strive towards simplicity.
