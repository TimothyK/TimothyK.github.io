            <p>
              So I thought I’d write down some tips for using a chat application
              effectively on a development team. Chat applications can
              revolutionize a how a development team works and even its culture.
              I’ll go through some of the goals of implementing a chat
              application, some best practices, and pitfalls.
            </p>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Goals</div>
              <p>
                Obviously the goal of a chat application is to improve
                communication amongst the team. It is meant to remove “silos”.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo"
                  >Silos</a
                >
                refers to an organizational structure where members of the same
                team do not communicate directly with each other. The image of a
                silo is a very tall structure with a very small opening (for
                communication) at the top or bottom. Developers aren’t given
                good opportunities to communicate with each other except through
                their manager or what they deliver.
              </p>
              <p>
                Silos are bad for development environments because often
                different members of the team will duplicate work. They aren’t
                aware that others have already solved the same problem. Or worse
                yet, the work of different team members can be divergent,
                pulling the products and development strategies is different,
                conflicting directions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The answer to this in the Agile and Scrum movements is “The
                Daily Stand-up”. This is a brief meeting at that start of the
                day where everyone gets together to let the team know what they
                are working on. The typical structure of the meeting is to
                answer “3 questions”: What did I do yesterday, what will I do
                today, and what impediments are getting in my way. Just by
                answering these questions publically to the team can be very
                effective in breaking down silos.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the problems with the Daily Stand-Up is that it does take
                some coordination. Everyone has to get together at the same time
                and in the same physical space. The meeting can’t start until
                everyone arrives. This can be problematic if different people
                are on different schedules. Remote developers and different time
                zones, client phone calls, and traffic delays can all infer with
                this. A chat application can be a very low friction way to allow
                this meeting to happen with the flexibility for people’s
                schedules and locations.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also allows for updates to be posted multiple times a day. If
                someone runs into an impediment they don’t have to wait until
                the next morning to seek the team’s help.
              </p>
              <p>
                The chat application is well sized as a communication medium for
                this problem. Phone calls or face-to-face meetings can be
                <a
                  href="http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/"
                  >highly disruptive</a
                >. Developers are forced to drop what they are doing
                immediately. It can take from 10 to 25 minutes or more to
                recover from the interruption. Email on the other hand can
                become too long winded. It lacks the brevity that chat
                encourages. When email is used as chat the large number of chat
                emails can make drowned out the important emails. Chat seems to
                be a happy median between these extremes. It is brief and it can
                be easily deferred and non-interruptive when desired.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chat can also improve the interpersonal relationships on a team.
                Instead of the only <sub></sub><sub></sub>team communication
                being at a biweekly manager-supervised sprint planning meeting,
                communication occurs daily. Most developers know how disruptive
                face-to-face communication can be, therefore they avoid it. Chat
                is less formal, non-intrusive vehicle for developers to
                interact.

                Getting Started – The Daily Stand-up
              </div>
              <p>
                So to get started using a chat application on a developer team,
                I’d suggest starting with the Daily Stand-up 3 Questions: What I
                did yesterday, today, and impediments. That is the standard
                format for the physical stand-up meeting.
              </p>
              <p>
                I don’t think that chatting about yesterday is needed, because
                all the chat history is there. But letting people know what you
                are about to work on and anything getting in your way is
                critical.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">No Surprises</div>
              <p>
                Chat can be used to post whenever a release is made of software.
                Most chat applications allow for these postings to be done
                automatically from the build process. This makes sure that
                everyone is aware of changes that have been made to the product.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although learning what has been done is nice, it is best if the
                chat contains information about what is about to be done before
                it is done. Sometimes release announcements can be greeted with
                “you released what?!!”. Work items should be bookended in the
                chat application so that people are clear when work starts and
                ends. This way there are no surprises.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main advantage of the chat application is informing the team
                what is being worked on at the earliest possible moment. This
                allows for feedback to be received as soon as possible and nip
                any problem in the bud. There are a number of advantages to
                announcing before work is done as opposed to after.
              </p>
              <p>
                It corrects any communication errors around priorities. If you
                are working on the wrong thing, this will quickly be caught.
                This can also prevent
                <a
                  href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html"
                  >yak shaving</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chatting allows to catch duplicate work before it is done. I
                someone posts that they are working on a class to process
                command line arguments, other on the team can intervene and
                point to the location where that code is already written.
              </p>
              <p>
                This process also works good for design. The chat application
                can serve as a good brainstorming tool. It can allow for
                feedback on designs in their infancy. Many think that designs
                are very mutable as long as they haven’t reached the
                implementation stage (coding) yet. However spending days
                designing and documenting a new feature can cement the mindset
                on the proposed design. The design review can become a violent
                defense of one person’s design rather than an open discussion.
                If feedback was allowed before the initial documentation is done
                the design much more fluid and open to change.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chat works well after the design meeting as well. At that design
                meeting there is usually an agreement of how the code should be
                implemented. However when coding occurs you usually run into one
                or two minor details that weren’t thought though well enough in
                the design meeting. The design needs to be changed ever so
                slightly. It is really a small change and doesn’t warrant
                reconvening the entire design review committee. However over the
                course of a week or two there may be several of these very small
                design changes that begin to add up. The coders can post on the
                chat the small corrections they are making to the design so that
                no one is surprised.
              </p>
              <p>
                When coding you are never writing the same code, solving the
                same problems day after day. Everyday you take the product is a
                slightly new direction or learn a new technique. You’re
                constantly faced with a couple different options. Each decision
                made should be broadcast so that the team has a common vision of
                the path being taken.
              </p>

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Conversation Starters</div>
              <p>
                Not all chat posts are made because you are seeking immediate
                feedback. Sometimes they are a reminder for a future
                conversation. When I meet with friends or family and they ask,
                “what I’ve been up to?”, I often struggle for an answer. It is
                usually the standard “same old, same old, nothing much, work and
                home”. However, if I share Facebook with them the posts often
                spawn a conversation. Didn’t you go camping or to a concert a
                few weeks ago? How was that? Using chat on a development team
                can be similar. Weren’t you working on some encryption
                algorithm? How did that turn out?

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Today I Learned</div>
              <p>
                “Today I Learned (TIL)” posts are also great for chat. If you
                learned something new today then it is likely that there is at
                least one other member of the team that doesn’t know that
                either.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chat is good for just educate other team members what your dark
                corner of the system. You may be working on components that some
                members on the team might not even know exist. Use the chat to
                teach others about the system.

              <p>
                To get better at something you need to practice. If you are
                currently estimating work at biweekly sprint planning meetings
                then that is 26 opportunities to practice estimating per year.
                If you are posting daily or twice a day what you estimate you’ll
                be able to complete in the next few hours then that is hundreds
                of estimates per year.
              </p>

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Special Roles</div>
              <p>
                Chat can be great for monitoring support calls as well. It can
                give any developer insight into the types of problems that
                customer support is dealing with. Reoccurring issues can be
                noted and preventative action taken.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chat can also be helpful for on ramping new developers. The new
                hire will get the sense that the entire team is behind them,
                instead of just a single mentor. Chat exposes the training given
                and ensures there is no misinformation or inconsistencies.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">Anti Patterns</div>
              <p>
                If using Chat as a daily stand-up meeting there is the potential
                for the same problem. That is “zombie scrum”. The answers to the
                3 questions become a dull drone that is repeated day after day,
                “I’m working on the same thing today as I did yesterday, no
                impediments”. If you are listing your current work item as the
                same thing day after day, you are not being descriptive enough
                in your post.
              </p>
              <p>
                “No impediments” listed day after day is also an anti-pattern.
                If you haven’t posted any impediments in the last few weeks,
                then you might want to examine your chat history for an
                “elephant in the room”. I’m going to spend all day today
                resetting my test environment, and I have no impediments. Well
                maybe the fact that you’re spending all day to create a test
                environment and that step is not automated is the impediment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Be clear and informative on what you are working on. Don’t just
                state the program or component you are working on. What
                enhancement is being made? What value will that bring to the
                customer?
              </p>
              <p>
                Don’t simply quote bug numbers or source control check-in IDs.
                Don’t say read my design document or check the minutes of the
                meeting if you want details. Give some details on the work that
                is being done. Describe what decisions are being made about how
                something is being implemented. Give some quick highlights of
                any external references.
              </p>
              <p>
                Be respectful. Don’t use the chat for public hazing. If you
                think your comments might be considered overly critical, discuss
                them privately first. Let the original poster correct or clarify
                their statements instead of being corrected by others.

                Sometimes chat or other meetings can get in the way of getting
                work done. It is OK to turn off the chat application, email, and
                take the phone off the hook to get a task done. Most chat
                applications do have a “do not disturb” feature.

                However, do remember to turn it back on when you are ready to
                reengage with the team. Review the posts that happened while you
                were dark. Obviously, a way the chat system can fail is if
                nobody uses it. Another way it can fail is if people just
                “lurk”. They will read what people are posting, but not offer up
                any comments of their own. They may be reluctant to post out of
                fear of saying something stupid. It might be an

                else probably already knows. In order for Chat to be successful,
                you must be active.
