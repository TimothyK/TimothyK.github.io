                So I gave a talk at the
                <a
                  href="https://www.meetup.com/Edmonton-NET-User-Group/events/236547165/"

                on an introduction to automated testing. And of course in this
                introduction I gave a list of reasons why unit testing is a good
                idea. Although there are already many blog posts other there on
                this subject, I thought I’d record my reasons here.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although all of these reasons may appeal to your hipster,
                idealistic sense of craftsmanship and professionalism, each of
                these reasons also has a sound business foundation. Automated
                testing saves/makes you money.

              <div class="section-header">1. Product Quality</div>
              <p>
                Of course the most obvious reason for automated testing is to
                improve product quality. Although automated testing will not
                guarantee that you’ll never have another bug, it will lower that
                bug rate. And having <u>working</u> software is the
                <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html"
                  >#1 design goal</a
                >. Telling customers about the automated testing that is in
                place can be a strong marketing point.
              </p>
              <p>Nobody will buy software that doesn’t work.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">
                2. Because you are doing it anyway
              </div>
              <p>
                If you aren’t doing automated testing, then you are doing manual
                testing. Manual testing (and all testing) is a thankless job
                that doesn’t get the credit it deserves. A lot of people assume
                it just happens for free.
              </p>
              <p>
                Manual testing does take a lot of time and effort. To run a test
                takes a lot of time just to set up. For example, confirming how
                the system behaves with a customer with bad credit. You have to
                create or find a customer record and change its credit status.
                Once the setup is done comes the actual testing. You have to run
                the program, login as the customer, and attempt to make a
                purchase. This all takes time, several minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Setting up an automated test also takes quite a bit of time.
                This is especially true for the first test. However the good
                news is you only have to do this once. Once the test is written
                you can run it as often as you want, several times an hour
                typically. Also running the test is much faster; no having to
                start the program, login, and all the other typing and button
                clicks. And the code you write to setup your first test will be
                reused for all the other tests.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the first test is the most difficult to write, before
                the first production build of your program the time spent
                building an automated test suite will be less that then time it
                takes to manually test the same program once. And once the
                automation is in place, it can be run whenever virtually
                instantaneously.
              </p>
              <p>
                Automated testing takes less time than manual testing. This is
                certainly true in the full lifecycle of the program, but is even
                true before the first production release.

            <section>
              <div class="section-header">3. Enables Refactoring</div>
              <p>
                Refactoring is the practice of going back over existing code and
                improving the readability of it. It removes
                <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html"
                  >technical debt</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                A common practice on my team is doing code reviews, especially
                with new hires. The result of code review is often a list things
                that should have been done differently. On receiving these
                suggestions the programmer asks, should I implement those
                changes. The answer is, it depends.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the testing has been done manually then the answer is often
                “no”. The code review is at the end of the project and we are up
                against a deadline. Although the changes may be fairly simple,
                the effort to manually retest the program does not out weight
                benefits of the cleaner code. It is usually just too risky to
                change the program.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is true not only for the first release, but future
                maintenance cycles. When other developers go into the same code
                base and need to make a minor enhancement. The risk that
                changing the program will introduce a bug is too high.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, having a single program contain two design styles
                is a sin unto itself. New features will likely be implemented
                following the example of the design already in place. The bad
                design will perpetuate. This is similar to the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory"
                  >Broken Windows Theory</a
                >. The code begins to rot. Eventually it reaches the point where
                the only course of action is to throw the existing code away and
                begin a full rewrite.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if the program supports an automated test suite the
                answer to if the code should be improved is usually “yes”. The
                very first time I used unit testing we did the normal code
                review process and the experience was completely different than
                previously. Even though the code review was done only hours
                before the deadline, most of the suggestions were implement
                before the release. This was because changes could be made
                without the penalty of a long testing cycle and risk of
                introducing a bug.
              </p>
              <p>
                The quality of code for a program without unit tests will only
                degrade over time. A program with unit tests will improve in
                quality over time. This improves the longevity of the program
                and avoids “the big rewrite”.

              <div class="section-header">4. Better Design</div>
              <p>
                This point is a little controversial, but in general unit
                testing will improve the design of a program. Code that is
                testable will be designed to be smaller. It will yield code that
                better follows the Single Responsibility Principal. It will be
                less coupled to other parts of the system and have better reuse
                potential.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is an excellent video by Michael Feathers on why and how
                unit testing encourages good design:
                <a
                  title="https://vimeo.com/15007792"
                  href="https://vimeo.com/15007792"
                  >https://vimeo.com/15007792</a
                >. It states it much better than I can.
              </p>
              <p>
                The counter argument is that sometimes this can cause systems to
                become over designed. This point was made by David Heinemeier
                Hansson in
                <a
                  href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html"
                  >a blog post</a
                >. This caused much debate on the internet, some of which was
                captured here between David and Kent Beck in this
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9quxZsLcfo"

              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the day, the programmer is in control of the
                design of the system. Doing Test Driven Development is a tool
                that helps with design, but it does not take away decisions from
                the programmer. Automated testing forces programmers to think
                more diligently about design and makes them better designers.

              <div class="section-header">5. Quicker Feedback Loop</div>
              <p>
                Staying in “the zone” is critical to being productive while
                developing software. There are dozens of pieces of information
                and background context that need to be kept in mind while
                programming. When you switch from one task to another there is a
                <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-multi-tasking-myth/"
                  >productivity drop of 20%</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                With manual testing often the developer implements a feature,
                compiles it a week later, it sits in the tester’s inbox for a
                week, tested, then the test results get analyzed by the
                developer a week later. It is common there is a 2 or 3 week gap
                between implementation and the time you need to fix it. When the
                test results are received it can take hours to reproduce the
                issue and find the offending line of code.
              </p>
              <p>
                With unit testing the workflow is write a line or two of code,
                then run the tests. When a test fails it is simple to remember
                the line of code that caused the bug. That’s because you just
                wrote that line of code a minute ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unit testing takes the debugging process from an hour or more to
                a minute or less. Unit testing adds productivity due to the
                short feedback loop.

              <p>
                The great thing about automated testing is that once the test is
                created it is saved and shared with the entire team. Every other
                team member pull in that test when they do their testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a developer implements another user case scenario that is in
                conflict with existing features the automated tests will reveal
                this immediately. All developers on the team must support all
                the features of the system, not just the small part of the
                system they are working on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Automated testing ensures that older tests are always run (i.e.
                regression testing). This prevents breaking changes from
                affecting existing customers. It improves communication on the
                team because all these cases are known.

                With all development, but especially with APIs, providing
                working examples of how the code should be called and what the
                expected results are is important. Automated tests can provide
                these examples.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also the automated tests will never become stale like a English
                document may become. The tests are guaranteed to stay current
                with the production code because they are run with every build.

              <p>
                Manual testing is a boring, tedious job. Running the same test
                scripts over and over again is mind numbing. What is boring and
                tedious should be automated. This is what computers are good at.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most developers find the challenge of automating testing to be
                enjoyable. Asking employees to do a job that is boring will
                likely cause them to quit.
              </p>
              <p>
                And also, it is no fun having customers yell at you because the
                software doesn’t work. Bugs lead to blame. Blame leads to fear.
                Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to
                suffering. ~Yoda

                When getting started with automated testing (or any new
                technology or process) there will be resistance. You will hear
                the fallacies that it will take too long, its too hard, or it
                will hurt the design. Whatever the reasons you have for not
                doing automated testing, don’t let that you don’t know how be
                one of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The harshest critic of automated testing will still conceded
                that in some circumstances it is still proper thing to do.
                Therefore when the time comes that testing should be automated
                ensure that you and your team are proficient in doing so. It is
                a skill that can only be learned from practice.
