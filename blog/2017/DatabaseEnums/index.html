              So is it better to store enumerated types in a database as a
              string/varchar or integer? Well it depends, but in general as a
              string is your best bet. In this post I explore the pros and cons
              of each.

                    Lists verse Enums
                  </div>
              <p>
                Before we get to that let’s first be clear that I’m talking about
                enums here, not lists. Let me explain the difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example let’s say to have a list of a available weight units:
                pounds, kilograms, grams, short tons, metric tons, long tons,
                stones, ounces, and etcetera. You might be able to design your
                database so that the list of possible weight units is in a table.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your application should not have any advanced knowledge of the
                weight units that are defined in this table. The application reads
                this dynamic list at run time. Any information needed about these
                weight units must come from the database. This includes conversion
                factors, display names with multilingual support, flags to
                indicate in which situations it is appropriate to offer these
                units as a choice, mapping rules to external systems, and anything
                else the application may need. There should be no requirements
                that pounds must exist as a row or that kilograms must always be
                ID #1.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you can soft code every behaviour of the weight unit required
                by applications in the database then the best design is to soft
                code this in a table. Installers may add or remove rows from this
                table as needed. This is a “List” of available values, which is
                defined in a database table.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the available weight units is hard coded into the application
                as an enum or
                <a
                  href="../../2014/StronglyTypedEnum/"
                  >strongly typed enum</a
                >
                then this is an “enum” not a “list”. The available values cannot
                change without changes to the programs. Therefore the available
                values should not be a database table. Adding support for new
                weight units requires code changes, so it is to the code that you
                must go to make this change. Having a database table falsely
                implies that the values are easy to change.

                The main argument for storing enum values as strings instead of
                integers is for human readability. People looking at the
                database can easily see what the values mean. Which of these two
                tables is easier to read?

                Storing the values as a string makes it immediately obvious to
                anyone looking at the database what the units are. There is no
                need have external lookup tables either as database tables,
                database functions, or external documentation. It simply makes
                the system faster and easier to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                The principle is similar to how applications should be developed
                so that users can get around with a minimum number of clicks.
                Adding just a few hundred milliseconds to the load time of a web
                page can cost thousands of dollars of lost sales. Even if the
                only people looking at the database are your own employees (i.e.
                a “captive audience”) the lookup time is still burdensome. Even
                if users have the IDs memorized, there is still a non-zero
                amount of time that it takes for the mental jumping jacks to
                make this conversion. There is a real cost to this lookup.

              <div class="section-header">Validation</div>
              <p>
                String enum columns usually offer better validation and data
                quality. If someone enters a “jf” instead of “kg” for the units
                it is very obvious that a mistake has been made. Whereas fat
                fingers on the number pad entering pressing 2 instead of 1 is
                much harder to detect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having a 1 digit password is not a good idea. Making your
                password at least 2 or 3 characters gives much better
                reassurance that a monkey banging on the keyboard isn’t going to
                happen upon a valid, yet totally random and incorrect value.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless on whether you choose to have enum values stored as
                integers or strings, it is a good idea to add a check constraint
                on the column to limit the values. In SQL Server, the T-SQL code
                to add a check constraint is as follows:
              </p>
                <code><pre>
  Alter Table Orders
  Add Constraint CHK_Orders_WeightUnits 
    Check(WeightUnits In ('kg', 'lb'))
    </pre></code>
              <p>
                There are also pros and cons to adding the check constraint to
                the database. The downside is that if you want to enhance your
                program to support a new enum value you must modify both the
                program and the database constraint.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need to time the upgrades to the application and database.
                In general, update the programs to support the new values if the
                are read from the database, then update the database constraint
                to allow the new values, then update the applications (or
                feature toggle) to allow the new values to be written to the
                database.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <div class="section-header">Performance</div>
              <p>
                I do acknowledge that using integers over strings gives better
                performance. Databases are smaller, less data is transferred
                over the network, and in theory faster. Exactly how much faster?
                I’m not sure, I haven’t run the benchmarks. Even with storing
                enums and strings I aim to have all my queries run in a few
                milliseconds. In most cases, I would categorize using integers
                over strings to be a micro-optimization.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, when creating the enum string values do try to use as
                little space as possible. You don’t want to make your enum
                values dozens of characters long. Always try to keep these
                values less than 10 characters. Try to use abbreviations to
                reduce the values further down to 2 or 3 characters. Always use
                varchar instead of nvarchar.
              </p>
              <p>
                For normal table columns I don’t think there is a significant
                performance hit in using strings. However, one place I might
                consider using an integer is if the column was used as part of
                an index. Database indexes are meant to make databases go fast,
                therefore every effort should be made to optimize these.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it is rare that enum (or Boolean) columns are used in
                indexes. In general those types of columns don’t make for good
                indexes. The goal of a database index is to take a table with a
                million rows and narrow that row count down to just the few rows
                you are searching for. Dates and free text (e.g. a person’s last
                name) are good candidates for indexes because they drill down
                from millions of rows to just a few - quickly. With an enum with
                5 possible values, including the enum in the index is only going
                to reduce the millions of rows by a fifth (still hundreds of
                thousands).
              </p>
              <p>
                If there is an enum value that does significantly reduce the row
                count, then consider using a filtered index. Put the enum value
                in the filter and not directly in the index. In that case the
                string enum value isn’t stored in the index; it is just used to
                decide which rows to put in the index.
              </p>
              <code><pre>
    Create Index IX_Orders_StatusUnderReview 
    On dbo.Orders(OrderID) 
    Where (Status = 'Review')
  </pre></code>
                            <p>
                With this query the <code>
                  Select * From Orders Where (Status = 'Review')
                </code> does use this index even though the Status column is
                not an indexed column.
