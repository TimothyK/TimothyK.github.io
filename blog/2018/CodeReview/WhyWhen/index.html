              This is a 2 part blog post on code reviews. This first post is on
              why and when code reviews should be done and some of the soft
              skills needed. The second post is a technical checklist on some
              things to look for during a code review.

              <div class="section-header">Why</div>
              <p>
                Code reviews are arguably the most effective means to bring
                continuous improvement to your coding skills. Code reviews are
                not an attempt to write perfect code, if there is such a thing.
                Code reviews are not about improving the current project or
                squashing bugs, although those are certainly beneficial side
                effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Code reviews will improve your coding skills. By practicing
                better coding on the current project, those coding skills will
                be taken to your next project. The code written on that next
                project will then ever so slightly better that previous project.
                It might not be a lot, maybe just 0.5% better. However, if you
                then do a code review on the next project that improvement
                starts to build on each other. Through the miracle of compound
                interest and a long career of hundreds of code reviews becoming
                a

                may be a real possibility.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">When</div>
              <p>
                Code reviews should be done often. Ideally, they should be done
                daily, on every check-in. The more often it is done the tighter
                the feedback loop is. If you only do a code review once per
                month then you may be repeating the same mistake every day for a
                month. In addition, you might be going down the wrong path
                altogether. The more often code reviews are done the greater
                that “compound interest”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another reason to do code reviews often is to prevent fatigue.
                Doing code reviews for 30 to 60 minutes a day is not that bad.
                Spending more that 90 to 120 minutes on a task can easily lead
                to fatigue. Less than an hour should be enough time to review a
                day’s of code. If you are reviewing a month of coding it can
                take a week. The greater the backlog of code to review, the more
                unlikely it will be reviewed. The code that could use
                improvement just ends up getting rubberstamped.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">Practice</div>
              <p>
                It is critically important that following a code review the
                suggested changes be implemented. If you don’t practice making
                the suggested changes they are easily dismissed, ignored, or
                forgotten when it comes to working on the next coding
                assignment. Practice makes perfect.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">Discuss</div>
              <p>
                Coding is about making decisions. I could code it this way, or
                that way. It should be a conscience decision regarding which is
                the best way. There should be a reason as to why you chose to
                implement it the way you did.
              </p>
              <p>
                A code review is just a critique on those decisions. When asked
                you should be able to discuss the various ways the program could
                have been implemented and the pros and cons of each, which led
                to the decision you made. The reviewer should make sure that the
                proper compromises are being made, and present new options the
                coder may not have considered.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coding decisions should not be made by arbitrary reasons, such
                as “that’s what the code I was copying was doing” or “that’s
                just my style”. If you are a “professional” coder that means you
                are writing code for money. Ideally producing code with the
                lowest cost to maintain. It should be simple for those that read
                your code to understand what they code is doing and why. The
                easier it is to read, the cheaper the code base will be to
                maintain. If someone can read your code and understand it in 15
                seconds that makes them more productive that if it takes 60
                seconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                Decisions should be rooted in the generally accepted
                industry-best software principles. Those principles are designed
                to produce easy to maintain code.

                Refactored code might look very different from the original.
                That does not mean that the original code was thrown away. It
                was probably just reorganized and reformatted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Or, maybe it was completely thrown away and rewritten; that’s OK
                too. Looking at problems from different directions and
                experimenting builds valuable knowledge and skills.

                  >Katas</a
                >
                encourage experimenting with different ways to solve the same
                problem. Although Katas are great, sometimes experimentation
                needs to be done during work hours on production code.
              </p>
              <p>
                If after a code review it is decided to “start over”, remember
                you are not your code. Just because another approach is going to
                be tried does not mean the original work was without value. You
                must separate your own ego from your code. You must be an

              <p>
                Those discussions sometimes may turn to arguments. Sometimes
                there is yelling and tears. I have been in yelling matches with
                numerous people over both code I authored and have reviewed.
                I’ve been dismissive and downright rude to reviewers. I’m not
                proud of those things, but they did happened.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember to keep a cool head. Keep your ego separate from the
                code under review.
              </p>
              <p>
                Be prepared to compromise. Look at the big picture and ask
                yourself if this is the hill I want to die on. Don’t get into a
                duel to the death over tabs verse spaces. Ask yourself, “is it
                really that important?”
              </p>
              <p>
                Be analytical, not emotional. Test the code against known coding
                standards, not an arbitrary sense of “that’s not the way I’d do
                it”. Try implementing something both ways and compare. Measure
                if you can.
